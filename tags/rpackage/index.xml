In many countries, DHS provide the key data that mark progress towards targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and inform health policy. Though standard health indicators are routinely published in survey final reports, much of the value of DHS is derived from the ability to download and analyse standardized microdata datasets for subgroup analysis, pooled multi-country analysis, and extended research studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The suite of tools within &lt;code>rdhs&lt;/code> improves the accessibility of these datasets for statistical analysis with R, with aim to support reproducible global health research and simplify common analytical pipelines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>magenta</title><link>https://nicholasbrazeau.com/project/magenta/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 08:00:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://nicholasbrazeau.com/project/magenta/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;code>magenta&lt;/code> is an individual-based simulation model of malaria epidemiology and parasite genetics, which was designed to extends the Imperial malaria model by tracking the infection history of individuals. With this addition, genetic characteristics of the parasite can be assessed for looking at both neutral genetic variation as well as loci under selection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first and main research paper based on this project was published in MBE&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, which showed the extenet to which parasite genetic traits could be used to infer malaria transmission intensity.&lt;/p>
