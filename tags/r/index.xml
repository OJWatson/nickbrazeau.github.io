In many countries, DHS provide the key data that mark progress towards targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and inform health policy. Though standard health indicators are routinely published in survey final reports, much of the value of DHS is derived from the ability to download and analyse standardized microdata datasets for subgroup analysis, pooled multi-country analysis, and extended research studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The suite of tools within &lt;code>rdhs&lt;/code> improves the accessibility of these datasets for statistical analysis with R, with aim to support reproducible global health research and simplify common analytical pipelines.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
