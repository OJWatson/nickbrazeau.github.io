abstract: The emergence of artemisinin resistance among Plasmodium falciparum in the
  Greater Mekong subregion threatens malaria control interventions and is associated
  with multiple unique mutations in K13 (PF3D7_1343700). The aim of this study was
  to survey Cambodian Plasmodium vivax for mutations in the K13 ortholog (K12, PVX_083080)
  that might similarly confer artemisinin resistance. Extracted DNA from Cambodian
  isolates collected between 2009 and 2012 was pooled by province and year and submitted
  for next-generation sequencing. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified
  using a pile-up approach that detected minority SNPs. Among the 14 pools, we found
  six unique SNPs, including three nonsynonymous SNPs, across six codons in K12 However,
  none of the SNPs were orthologous to artemisinin resistance-conferring mutations
  in PF3D7_1343700, and nonsynonymous changes did not persist through time within
  populations. These results suggest a lack of selection in the P. vivax population
  in Cambodia due to artemisinin drug pressure.
