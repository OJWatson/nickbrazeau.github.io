abstract: We explored spatial variation in the prevalence of established molecular
  markers of antimalarial resistance across a geographically diverse, highland region
  of western Uganda. We identified Plasmodium falciparum CQ resistance transporter
  76T mutations in all pools, but there was no evidence of spatial differences across
  village-based strata defined by either altitude or river valley. In contrast, we
  identified a significant inverse association between altitude and the prevalence
  of Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 mutations with the largest proportion
  of Y184F mutations observed in the low-elevation, high-transmission villages. These
  results demonstrate the substantial heterogeneity in resistance markers observed
  across geographic settings, even at relatively small scales, but highlight the complex
  nature of these ecological relationships.
