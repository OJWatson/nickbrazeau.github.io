abstract: The worldwide endeavour to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines
  has been extraordinary, and vaccination is now underway in many countries. However,
  the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extend a mathematical model
  of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public
  health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles.
  We identify optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries
  to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We find that the health
  impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection
  incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory
  of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively
  treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses
  for textless 20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly.
  However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions
  are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly
  protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection
  have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect
  protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in
  2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional
  to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical
  principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.
