abstract: Polymorphisms within Plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate antigens have
  the potential to compromise vaccine efficacy. Understanding the allele frequencies
  of polymorphisms in critical binding regions of antigens can help in the designing
  of strain-transcendent vaccines. Here, we adopt a pooled deep-sequencing approach,
  originally designed to study P. falciparum drug resistance mutations, to study the
  diversity of two leading transmission-blocking vaccine candidates, Pfs25 and Pfs48/45.
  We sequenced 329 P. falciparum field isolates from six different geographic regions.
  Pfs25 showed little diversity, with only one known polymorphism identified in the
  region associated with binding of transmission-blocking antibodies among our isolates.
  However, we identified four new mutations among eight non-synonymous mutations within
  the presumed antibody-binding region of Pfs48/45. Pooled deep sequencing provides
  a scalable and cost-effective approach for the targeted study of allele frequencies
  of P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens.
