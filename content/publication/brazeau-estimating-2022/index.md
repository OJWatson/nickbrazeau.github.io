abstract: 'Background: The infection fatality ratio (IFR) is a key statistic for estimating
  the burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been continuously debated
  throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The age-specific IFR can be quantified using antibody
  surveys to estimate total infections, but requires consideration of delay-distributions
  from time from infection to seroconversion, time to death, and time to seroreversion
  (i.e. antibody waning) alongside serologic test sensitivity and specificity. Previous
  IFR estimates have not fully propagated uncertainty or accounted for these potential
  biases, particularly seroreversion. Methods: We built a Bayesian statistical model
  that incorporates these factors and applied this model to simulated data and 10
  serologic studies from different countries. Results: We demonstrate that seroreversion
  becomes a crucial factor as time accrues but is less important during first-wave,
  short-term dynamics. We additionally show that disaggregating surveys by regions
  with higher versus lower disease burden can inform serologic test specificity estimates.
  The overall IFR in each setting was estimated at 0.49-2.53%. Conclusion: We developed
  a robust statistical framework to account for full uncertainties in the parameters
  determining IFR. We provide code for others to apply these methods to further datasets
  and future epidemics.'
