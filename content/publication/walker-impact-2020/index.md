abstract: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a severe
  threat to public health worldwide. We combine data on demography, contact patterns,
  disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact
  and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower-income countries
  may reduce overall risk, but limited health system capacity coupled with closer
  intergenerational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that
  slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly
  overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower-income countries
  resulting from the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken
  suppression to date, lower-income countries have acted earlier. However, this will
  need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below
  available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider
  health, well-being, and economies of these countries.
