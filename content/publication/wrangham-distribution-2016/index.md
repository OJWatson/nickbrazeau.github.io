abstract: High-arm grooming is a form of chimpanzee grooming in which two individuals
  mutually groom while each raising one arm. Palm-to-palm clasping (PPC) is a distinct
  style of high-arm grooming in which the grooming partners clasp each other's raised
  palms. In wild communities, samples of at least 100 observed dyads grooming with
  raised hands showed PPC frequencies varying from textless5% (M group, Mahale) to
  textgreater30% dyads grooming (Kanyawara, Kibale), and in a large free-ranging sanctuary
  group, the frequency reached textgreater80% dyads (group 1, Chimfunshi) [1, 2].
  Because between-community differences in frequency of PPC apparently result from
  social learning, are stable across generations, and last for at least 9 years, they
  are thought to be cultural, but the mechanism of transmission is unknown [2]. Here,
  we examine factors responsible for individual variation in PPC frequency within
  a single wild community. We found that in the Kanyawara community (Kibale, Uganda),
  adults of both sexes varied widely in their PPC frequency (from textless10% to textgreater50%)
  and did not converge on a central group tendency. However, frequencies of PPC were
  highly consistent within matrilines, indicating that individuals maintained lifelong
  fidelity to the grooming style of their mothers. Matrilineal inheritance of socially
  learned behaviors has previously been reported for tool use in chimpanzees [3] and
  in the vocal and feeding behavior of cetaceans [4, 5]. Our evidence indicates that
  matrilineal inheritance can be sufficiently strong in nonhuman primates to account
  for long-term differences in community traditions.
