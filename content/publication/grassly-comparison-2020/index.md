abstract: 'BACKGROUND: WHO has called for increased testing in response to the COVID-19
  pandemic, but countries have taken different approaches and the effectiveness of
  alternative strategies is unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential impact
  of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory
  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We developed a mathematical model
  of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over
  time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number
  (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening
  of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed
  cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of
  different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed
  data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative
  New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity
  passports. FINDINGS: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated
  and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation
  of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty
  interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom
  onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would
  also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives).
  Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective
  of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2
  transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation
  following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of
  test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing,
  potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation
  following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate
  testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently
  available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity
  around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA
  and chemiluminescent assays. INTERPRETATION: Molecular testing can play an important
  role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers
  and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current
  levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests
  for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges. FUNDING:
