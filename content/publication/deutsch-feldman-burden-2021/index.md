abstract: Despite evidence that older children and adolescents bear the highest burden
  of malaria, large malaria surveys focus on younger children. We used polymerase
  chain reaction data from the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey in the Democratic
  Republic of Congo (including children aged textless5 years and adults aged â‰¥15 years)
  and a longitudinal study in Kinshasa Province (participants aged 6 months to 98
  years) to estimate malaria prevalence across age strata. We fit linear models and
  estimated prevalences for each age category; adolescents aged 10-14 years had the
  highest prevalence. We estimate approximately 26 million polymerase chain reaction-detectable
  infections nationally. Adolescents and older children should be included in surveillance
  studies.
