abstract: "BACKGROUND: After experiencing a sharp growth in COVID-19 cases early in\
  \ the pandemic, South Korea rapidly controlled transmission while implementing less\
  \ stringent national social distancing measures than countries in Europe and the\
  \ USA. This has led to substantial interest in their \\\"test, trace, isolate\\\"\
  \ strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities\
  \ of South Korea's outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to\
  \ emulate these measures elsewhere. METHODS: We systematically extracted numbers\
  \ of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases,\
  \ and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly\
  \ available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using an\
  \ established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented\
  \ by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government\
  \ sources. RESULTS: We estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, Rt\
  \ dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI,\
  \ 1.64-2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June,\
  \ Rt was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th).\
  \ Despite less stringent \\\"lockdown\\\" measures, strong social distancing measures\
  \ were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national\
  \ decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased,\
  \ and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly;\
  \ however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting\
  \ for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively\
  \ minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: Whilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to\
  \ be important for South Korea's successful outbreak control, other factors including\
  \ regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed.\
  \ The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea\
  \ experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in\
  \ attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more\
  \ geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases\
  \ that are linked to clusters may be more difficult."
