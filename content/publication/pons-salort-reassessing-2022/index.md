abstract: India reported textgreater10 million coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases
  and 149,000 deaths in 2020. To reassess reported deaths and estimate incidence rates
  during the first 6 months of the epidemic, we used a severe acute respiratory syndrome
  coronavirus 2 transmission model fit to data from 3 serosurveys in Delhi and time-series
  documentation of reported deaths. We estimated 48.7% (95% credible interval 22.1%-76.8%)
  cumulative infection in the population through the end of September 2020. Using
  an age-adjusted overall infection fatality ratio based on age-specific estimates
  from mostly high-income countries, we estimated that just 15.0% (95% credible interval
  9.3%-34.0%) of COVID-19 deaths had been reported, indicating either substantial
  underreporting or lower age-specific infection-fatality ratios in India than in
  high-income countries. Despite the estimated high attack rate, additional epidemic
  waves occurred in late 2020 and April-May 2021. Future dynamics will depend on the
  duration of natural and vaccine-induced immunity and their effectiveness against
  new variants.
