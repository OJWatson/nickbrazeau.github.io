abstract: "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed\
  \ enormous strain on intensive care units (ICUs) in Europe. Ensuring access to care,\
  \ irrespective of COVID-19 status, in winter 2020-2021 is essential. METHODS: An\
  \ integrated model of hospital capacity planning and epidemiological projections\
  \ of COVID-19 patients is used to estimate the demand for and resultant spare capacity\
  \ of ICU beds, staff and ventilators under different epidemic scenarios in France,\
  \ Germany and Italy across the 2020-2021 winter period. The effect of implementing\
  \ lockdowns triggered by different numbers of COVID-19 patients in ICUs under varying\
  \ levels of effectiveness is examined, using a 'dual-demand' (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19)\
  \ patient model. RESULTS: Without sufficient mitigation, we estimate that COVID-19\
  \ ICU patient numbers will exceed those seen in the first peak, resulting in substantial\
  \ capacity deficits, with beds being consistently found to be the most constrained\
  \ resource. Reactive lockdowns could lead to large improvements in ICU capacity\
  \ during the winter season, with pressure being most effectively alleviated when\
  \ lockdown is triggered early and sustained under a higher level of suppression.\
  \ The success of such interventions also depends on baseline bed numbers and average\
  \ non-COVID-19 patient occupancy. CONCLUSION: Reductions in capacity deficits under\
  \ different scenarios must be weighed against the feasibility and drawbacks of further\
  \ lockdowns. Careful, continuous decision-making by national policymakers will be\
  \ required across the winter period 2020-2021."
