abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes is a significant problem among uninsured\
  \ patients. Shared medical appointments (SMA) have been shown to improve outcomes\
  \ in type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the SMA model could be adapted for a\
  \ non-profit clinic in North Carolina that serves uninsured patients with diabetes\
  \ that have incomes at/below 150% of the federal poverty line. RESEARCH DESIGN AND\
  \ METHODS: We implemented and sustained a patient-driven, student-led SMA model\
  \ that incorporated the monthly rotations of students, physician assistant, and\
  \ undergraduate students as well as pharmacy residents and an endocrinologist who\
  \ collectively provide diabetes care at the free clinic. SMA groups are 'open' cohorts\
  \ and include 4-12 patients scheduled for the monthly clinic. Teams of transdisciplinary\
  \ trainees work together to perform triage, medication reconciliation, brief history,\
  \ and physical exam, after which patients participate in the SMA. The endocrinologist\
  \ evaluates SMA patients individually during and after the visit. RESULTS: Between\
  \ November 2015 and January 2017, we enrolled 29 patients in SMA. There was high\
  \ variability in HbA1c at baseline. Among eight type 2 diabetes patients seen in\
  \ endocrine clinic and with complete data one year before and after SMA implementation,\
  \ the mean (SD) HbA1c before SMA was 9.7% ± 1.7% (83±7 mmol/ mol); mean HbA1c after\
  \ SMA was 9.2% ± 1.8% (77 ± 8mmol/mol). The median HbA1c before SMA was 9.5% (80\
  \ mmol/mol); median HbA1c after SMA was 8.9% (74 mmol/mol). Overall, 6/8 patients\
  \ showed decreased HbA1c after SMA although there was variability between individuals\
  \ in response of glycemic control to SMA. SMA increased clinic efficiency and offered\
  \ an opportunity to integrate transdisciplinary trainees. Trainees gain experience\
  \ with novel models of care and the complexities of the patient experience of diabetes.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: We hope this observation encourages others to implement such programs\
  \ to enhance the evidence-base for SMA to address health disparities and increase\
  \ the quality of free diabetes care."
