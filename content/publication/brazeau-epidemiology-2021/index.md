abstract: 'Reports of P. vivax infections among Duffy-negative hosts have accumulated
  throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this growing body of evidence, no nationally
  representative epidemiological surveys of P. vivax in sub-Saharan Africa have been
  performed. To overcome this gap in knowledge, we screened over 17,000 adults in
  the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for P. vivax using samples from the 2013-2014
  Demographic Health Survey. Overall, we found a 2.97% (95% CI: 2.28%, 3.65%) prevalence
  of P. vivax infections across the DRC. Infections were associated with few risk-factors
  and demonstrated a relatively flat distribution of prevalence across space with
  focal regions of relatively higher prevalence in the north and northeast. Mitochondrial
  genomes suggested that DRC P. vivax were distinct from circulating non-human ape
  strains and an ancestral European P. vivax strain, and instead may be part of a
  separate contemporary clade. Our findings suggest P. vivax is diffusely spread across
  the DRC at a low prevalence, which may be associated with long-term carriage of
  low parasitemia, frequent relapses, or a general pool of infections with limited
  forward propagation.'
