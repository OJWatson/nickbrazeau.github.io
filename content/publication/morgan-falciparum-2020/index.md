abstract: "BACKGROUND: Tanzania's Zanzibar archipelago has made significant gains\
  \ in malaria control over the last decade and is a target for malaria elimination.\
  \ Despite consistent implementation of effective tools since 2002, elimination has\
  \ not been achieved. Importation of parasites from outside of the archipelago is\
  \ thought to be an important cause of malaria's persistence, but this paradigm has\
  \ not been studied using modern genetic tools. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing\
  \ (WGS) was used to investigate the impact of importation, employing population\
  \ genetic analyses of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from both the archipelago and\
  \ mainland Tanzania. Ancestry, levels of genetic diversity and differentiation,\
  \ patterns of relatedness, and patterns of selection between these two populations\
  \ were assessed by leveraging recent advances in deconvolution of genomes from polyclonal\
  \ malaria infections. RESULTS: Significant decreases in the effective population\
  \ sizes were inferred in both populations that coincide with a period of decreasing\
  \ malaria transmission in Tanzania. Identity by descent analysis showed that parasites\
  \ in the two populations shared long segments of their genomes, on the order of\
  \ 5 cM, suggesting shared ancestry within the last 10 generations. Even with limited\
  \ sampling, two of isolates between the mainland and Zanzibar were identified that\
  \ are related at the expected level of half-siblings, consistent with recent importation.\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that importation plays an important role for\
  \ malaria incidence on Zanzibar and demonstrate the value of genomic approaches\
  \ for identifying corridors of parasite movement to the island."
