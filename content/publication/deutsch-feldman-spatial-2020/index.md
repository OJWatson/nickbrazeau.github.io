abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Adults are frequently infected with malaria and may serve as
  a reservoir for further transmission, yet we know relatively little about risk factors
  for adult infections. In this study, we assessed malaria risk factors among adults
  using samples from the nationally representative, cross-sectional 2013-2014 Demographic
  and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
  We further explored differences in risk factors by urbanicity. METHODS: Plasmodium
  falciparum infection was determined by PCR. Covariates were drawn from the DHS to
  model individual, community and environmental-level risk factors for infection.
  Additionally, we used deep sequencing data to estimate the community-level proportions
  of drug-resistant infections and included these estimates as potential risk factors.
  All identified factors were assessed for differences in associations by urbanicity.
  RESULTS: A total of 16 126 adults were included. Overall prevalence of malaria was
  30.3% (SE=1.1) by PCR; province-level prevalence ranged from 6.7% to 58.3%. Only
  17% of individuals lived in households with at least one bed-net for every two people,
  as recommended by the WHO. Protective factors included increasing within-household
  bed-net coverage (Prevalence Ratio=0.85, 95% CI=0.76-0.95) and modern housing (PR=0.58,
  95% CI=0.49-0.69). Community-level protective factors included increased median
  wealth (PR=0.87, 95% CI=0.83-0.92). Education, wealth, and modern housing showed
  protective associations in cities but not in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The DRC continues
  to suffer from a high burden of malaria; interventions that target high-risk groups
  and sustained investment in malaria control are sorely needed. Areas of high prevalence
  should be prioritised for interventions to target the largest reservoirs for further
  transmission.'
