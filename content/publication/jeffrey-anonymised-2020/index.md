abstract: "Background: Since early March 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic across the United\
  \ Kingdom has led to a range of social distancing policies, which have resulted\
  \ in reduced mobility across different regions. Crowd level data on mobile phone\
  \ usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide\
  \ a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility.\
  \ Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated\
  \ crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess\
  \ changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population\
  \ density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths. Results: We\
  \ show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most\
  \ rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister's announcement\
  \ of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across\
  \ the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a\
  \ gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets\
  \ produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see\
  \ slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density\
  \ areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density\
  \ areas eliminated almost all mobility. Conclusions: These analyses form a baseline\
  \ from which to observe changes in behaviour in the UK as social distancing is eased\
  \ and inform policy towards the future control of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK."
