abstract: Knowledge of chimpanzee development has played an essential role in our
  understanding of the evolution of human ontogeny. However, recent studies of wild
  ape dentitions have cast doubt on the use of developmental standards derived from
  captive individuals. Others have called into question the use of deceased wild individuals
  to infer normative development. We conducted a high resolution photographic study
  of living known-age subadults in the Kanyawara community (Kibale National Park,
  Uganda) to generate a comprehensive three year record of dental eruption (including
  tooth emergence ages). These non-invasive data allow comparisons of captive and
  wild chimpanzees, establish accurate developmental standards for relatively healthy
  wild individuals, and facilitate direct assessments of primate-wide associations
  between dental development and life history. Emergence ages in the Kanyawara chimpanzees
  are very similar to living Gombe chimpanzees, and are broadly comparable to deceased
  Ta√Ø Forest chimpanzees. Early-emerging teeth such as the deciduous dentition and
  first molar (M1) appear during a time of maternal dependence, and are almost indistinguishable
  from captive chimpanzee emergence ages, while later forming teeth in the Kanyawara
  population emerge in the latter half of captive age ranges or beyond. Five juveniles
  whose lower M1s emerged by or before 3.3 years of age continued to nurse for a year
  or more beyond M1 emergence, and their mothers showed considerable variation in
  reproductive rates. The third molars of two adolescent females emerged several months
  to several years prior to the birth of their first offspring. Given that broad primate-wide
  relationships between molar emergence and life history do not necessarily hold within
  this population of chimpanzees, particularly for variables that are reported to
  be coincident with molar emergence, we suggest that further study is required in
  order to predict life history variables in hominins or hominoids.
