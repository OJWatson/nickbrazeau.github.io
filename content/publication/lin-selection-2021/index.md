abstract: Atovaquone-proguanil remains effective against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium
  falciparum in Southeast Asia, but resistance is mediated by a single point mutation
  in cytochrome b (cytb) that can arise during treatment. Among 14 atovaquone-proguanil
  treatment failures in a clinical trial in Cambodia, only one recrudescence harbored
  the cytb mutation Y268C. Deep sequencing did not detect the mutation at baseline
  or in the first 3â€‰days of treatment, suggesting that it arose de novo Further sequencing
  across cytb similarly found no low-frequency cytb mutations that were up-selected
  from baseline to recrudescence. Copy number amplification in dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
  (DHODH) and cytb as markers of atovaquone tolerance was also absent. Cytb mutation
  played a minor role in atovaquone-proguanil treatment failures in an active comparator
  clinical trial.
