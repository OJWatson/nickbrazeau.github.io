abstract: For over fifty years, the pathogenesis of May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) has
  been associated with chronic left common iliac vein compression resulting in the
  formation of intraluminal, permanent obstructive lesions. However, despite this
  association, the mechanism by which compression produces these lesions is unknown.
  Diagnostic accuracy of MTS is critical since it often afflicts young patients requiring
  endovascular management. This review will focus on the historical, embryological
  and evolutionary description of MTS and examine its development, diagnosis, clinical
  management and potential diagnostic errors.
