abstract: 'Daptomycin (DAP) is key in treating multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus
  infections. Diminished susceptibility to DAP is emerging among Staphylococcus epidermidis
  strains although mechanisms for non-susceptibility (NS) remain poorly understood.
  We report a case of persistent S. epidermidis bacteremia in which loss of DAP susceptibility
  arose during prolonged treatment. Whole genome sequencing identified two mutations,
  Q371del and P415L, in a single-affected gene, WalK, that coincided with the emergence
  of DAP-NS. Protein modeling of the mutations predicted a disruption of WalK protein
  configuration. The emergence of mutations in a single-gene during DAP exposure raises
  concerns in an era of increasingly treatment-resistant infections. Lay summary:
  Daptomycin is an important antibiotic for fighting Staphylococcus infections. We
  identified variants in the WalK gene that were coincident with resistance in a clinical
  Staphylococcus epidermidis infection. Clinicians, hospital epidemiologists, and
  microbiology laboratories need to be aware of the potential for the evolution of
  drug resistance during prolonged daptomycin therapy.'
