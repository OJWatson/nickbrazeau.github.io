abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ovale is an understudied malaria species prevalent
  throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. Little is known about the distribution of
  ovale malaria and risk factors for infection in areas of high malaria endemicity.
  METHODS: Using the 2013 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Demographic and Health
  Survey, we conducted a risk factor analysis for P. ovale infections. We evaluated
  geographic clustering of infections and speciated to P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale
  wallikeri through deep sequencing. RESULTS: Of 18 149 adults tested, we detected
  143 prevalent P. ovale infections (prevalence estimate 0.8%; 95% confidence interval
  [CI], .59%-.98%). Prevalence ratios (PR) for significant risk factors were: male
  sex PR = 2.12 (95% CI, 1.38-3.26), coprevalent P. falciparum PR = 3.52 (95% CI,
  2.06-5.99), and rural residence PR = 2.19 (95% CI, 1.31-3.66). P. ovale was broadly
  distributed throughout the DRC; an elevated cluster of infections was detected in
  the south-central region. Speciation revealed P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri
  circulating throughout the country. CONCLUSIONS: P. ovale persists broadly in the
  DRC, a high malaria burden country. For successful elimination of all malaria species,
  P. ovale needs to be on the radar of malaria control programs.'
