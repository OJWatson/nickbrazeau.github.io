abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Drug resistant malaria is a growing concern in the Democratic
  Republic of the Congo (DRC), where previous studies indicate that parasites resistant
  to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine or chloroquine are spatially clustered. This study
  explores longitudinal changes in spatial patterns to understand how resistant malaria
  may be spreading within the DRC, using samples from nation-wide population-representative
  surveys. METHODS: We selected 552 children with PCR-detectable Plasmodium falciparum
  infection and identified known variants in the pfdhps and pfcrt genes associated
  with resistance. We compared the proportion of mutant parasites in 2013 to those
  previously reported from adults in 2007, and identified risk factors for carrying
  a resistant allele using multivariate mixed-effects modeling. Finally, we fit a
  spatial-temporal model to the observed data, providing smooth allele frequency estimates
  over space and time. RESULTS: The proportion of co-occurring pfdhps K540E/A581G
  mutations increased by 16% between 2007 and 2013. The spatial-temporal model suggests
  that the spatial range of the pfdhps double mutants expanded over time, while the
  prevalence and range of pfcrt mutations remained steady. CONCLUSIONS: This study
  uses population-representative samples to describe the changing landscape of SP
  resistance within the DRC, and the persistence of chloroquine resistance. Vigilant
  molecular surveillance is critical for controlling the spread of resistance.'
