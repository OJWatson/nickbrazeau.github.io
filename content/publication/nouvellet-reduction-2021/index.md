abstract: 'In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have sought to control
  SARS-CoV-2 transmission by restricting population movement through social distancing
  interventions, thus reducing the number of contacts. Mobility data represent an
  important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship
  between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission
  significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries
  analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following
  the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority
  of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility
  (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27-77%]).
  Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after
  the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49-91%])
  pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12-48%])
  post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission
  both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated
  with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that
  the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial.'
