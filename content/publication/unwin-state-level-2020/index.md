abstract: As of 1st June 2020, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported
  104,232 confirmed or probable COVID-19-related deaths in the US. This was more than
  twice the number of deaths reported in the next most severely impacted country.
  We jointly model the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death
  data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework. For each state,
  we estimate the number of individuals that have been infected, the number of individuals
  that are currently infectious and the time-varying reproduction number (the average
  number of secondary infections caused by an infected person). We use changes in
  mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour
  changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate that Rt was
  only below one in 23 states on 1st June. We also estimate that 3.7% [3.4%-4.0%]
  of the total population of the US had been infected, with wide variation between
  states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious. We demonstrate
  good 3 week model forecasts of deaths with low error and good coverage of our credible
  intervals.
