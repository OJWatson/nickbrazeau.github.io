abstract: 'PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the longitudinal stability of left common
  iliac vein (LCIV) compression by the right common iliac artery on magnetic resonance
  venography (MRV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 214 patients
  diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome by MRV. We identified a subset of patients who
  underwent contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging of the pelvis six months before
  or anytime after the MRV and did not undergo any interventional venous procedures
  between the two studies; 36 patients met these criteria. The degree of venous compression
  was calculated in both the index and comparison study. RESULTS: On the index MRV,
  the mean compression of the LCIV was 62%. However, on the comparison study in the
  same patients, the mean compression was 39%. The mean change in degree of compression
  between the two studies was 23% (P textless 0.0001), ranging from a 12% increase
  to 69% decrease in degree of compression on the comparison study. CONCLUSION: The
  compressed LCIV on a single MRV study was not stable over time and thus may be insufficient
  to diagnose May-Thurner syndrome.'
