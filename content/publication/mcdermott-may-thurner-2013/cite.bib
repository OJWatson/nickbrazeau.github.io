 abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the longitudinal stability of left common iliac vein (LCIV) compression by the right common iliac artery on magnetic resonance venography (MRV).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 214 patients diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome by MRV. We identified a subset of patients who underwent contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging of the pelvis six months before or anytime after the MRV and did not undergo any interventional venous procedures between the two studies; 36 patients met these criteria. The degree of venous compression was calculated in both the index and comparison study.
RESULTS: On the index MRV, the mean compression of the LCIV was 62%. However, on the comparison study in the same patients, the mean compression was 39%. The mean change in degree of compression between the two studies was 23% (P \textless 0.0001), ranging from a 12% increase to 69% decrease in degree of compression on the comparison study.
CONCLUSION: The compressed LCIV on a single MRV study was not stable over time and thus may be insufficient to diagnose May-Thurner syndrome.},
