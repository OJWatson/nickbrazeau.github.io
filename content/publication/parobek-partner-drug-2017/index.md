abstract: Plasmodium falciparum in western Cambodia has developed resistance to artemisinin
  and its partner drugs, causing frequent treatment failure. Understanding this evolution
  can inform the deployment of new therapies. We investigated the genetic architecture
  of 78 falciparum isolates using whole-genome sequencing, correlating results to
  in vivo and ex vivo drug resistance and exploring the relationship between population
  structure, demographic history, and partner drug resistance. Principle component
  analysis, network analysis and demographic inference identified a diverse central
  population with three clusters of clonally expanding parasite populations, each
  associated with specific K13 artemisinin resistance alleles and partner drug resistance
  profiles which were consistent with the sequential deployment of artemisinin combination
  therapies in the region. One cluster displayed ex vivo piperaquine resistance and
  mefloquine sensitivity with a high rate of in vivo failure of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.
  Another cluster displayed ex vivo mefloquine resistance and piperaquine sensitivity
  with high in vivo efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The final cluster
  was clonal and displayed intermediate sensitivity to both drugs. Variations in recently
  described piperaquine resistance markers did not explain the difference in mean
  IC90 or clinical failures between the high and intermediate piperaquine resistance
  groups, suggesting additional loci may be involved in resistance. The results highlight
  an important role for partner drug resistance in shaping the P. falciparum genetic
  landscape in Southeast Asia and suggest that further work is needed to evaluate
  for other mutations that drive piperaquine resistance.
