abstract: 'BACKGROUND: As in many countries, quantifying COVID-19 spread in Indonesia
  remains challenging due to testing limitations. In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions
  (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches,
  cases and deaths are rising across the island. METHODS: We used modelling to explore
  the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P)
  provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory,
  and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will
  shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine rollout. RESULTS: C19P burial
  data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported.
  Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained
  impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan,
  substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory,
  daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is
  rolled out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of
  control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead
  to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign.
  CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of
  COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact
  of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and
  dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term
  will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact.'
