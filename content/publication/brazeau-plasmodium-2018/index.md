abstract: Although Plasmodium vivax has been assumed to be absent from sub-Saharan
  Africa because of the protective mutation conferring the Duffy-negative phenotype,
  recent evidence has suggested that P. vivax cases are prevalent in these regions.
  We selected 292 dried blood spots from children who participated in the 2013-2014
  Demographic and Health Survey of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to
  assess for P. vivax infection. Four P. vivax infections were identified by polymerase
  chain reaction, each in a geographically different survey cluster. Using these as
  index cases, we tested the remaining 73 samples from the four clusters. With this
  approach, 10 confirmed cases, three probable cases, and one possible case of P.
  vivax were identified. Among the 14 P. vivax cases, nine were coinfected with Plasmodium
  falciparum. All 14 individuals were confirmed to be Duffy-negative by sequencing
  for the single point mutation in the GATA motif that represses the expression of
  the Duffy antigen. This finding is consistent with a growing body of literature
  that suggests that P. vivax can infect Duffy-negative individuals in Africa. Future
  molecular and sequencing work is needed to understand the relationship of these
  isolates with other P. vivax samples from Asia and South America and discover variants
  linked to P. vivax virulence and erythrocyte invasion.
