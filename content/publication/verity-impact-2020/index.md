abstract: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) harbors 11% of global malaria
  cases, yet little is known about the spatial and genetic structure of the parasite
  population in that country. We sequence 2537 Plasmodium falciparum infections, including
  a nationally representative population sample from DRC and samples from surrounding
  countries, using molecular inversion probes - a high-throughput genotyping tool.
  We identify an east-west divide in haplotypes known to confer resistance to chloroquine
  and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Furthermore, we identify highly related parasites
  over large geographic distances, indicative of gene flow and migration. Our results
  are consistent with a background of isolation by distance combined with the effects
  of selection for antimalarial drug resistance. This study provides a high-resolution
  view of parasite genetic structure across a large country in Africa and provides
  a baseline to study how implementation programs may impact parasite populations.
