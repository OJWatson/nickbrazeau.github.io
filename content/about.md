Most people call me Nick. I grew up in North Carolina and Michigan and am proud to have an accent that makes absolutely no sense. I graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor's degree in Human Evolutionary Biology with _Magna Cum Lauda_ distinction as well as completing my undergraduate dissertation on the evolution of chimpanzee growth patterns under the direction of Zarin Machanda and Richard Wrangham, for which I earned _Highest Honors_ and the Thomas T. Hoopes Prize. Following this, I spent nine months on a Fulbright Scholarship studying chimpanzees in the Kanyawara forest with the [Kibale Chimpanzee Project](https://kibalechimpanzees.wordpress.com/). I then matriculated with the University of North Carolina Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD Program).

At UNC, I completed my PhD in Epidemiology from the Gillings School of Global Public Health, focusing on infectious diseases. My dissertation work was completed under Jonathan Juliano and the late [Steven Meshnick](https://www.astmh.org/blog/august-2020/in-memoriam-steven-meshnick,-md,-phd,-fastmh), as part of the [IDEEL@UNC](https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/infdis/ideel/) group. The work focused on the molecular, spatial, and genetic distribution  of malaria in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, alongside a few other locations and "side projects".

In 2020, I joined Imperial College London as a research associate and soon onboarded onto the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team. My work focused on re-estimating the infection fatality ratio using statistical modeling with a Bayesian approach under the direction of Robert Verity, Lucy Okell, Azra Ghani, and Neil Ferguson.


In addition to being an infectious disease and molecular epidemiologist, I am also a great admirer of statistics (especially Bayesian methods), mathematical modeling, genetics, geography, and bioinformatics and do my best to imitate those experts and their skillsets. Currently, as part of my MD training, I am trying to grow out my white coat (at present: buzz cut level) at UNC-SOM until May 2023. In the long-term, I plan on joining these passions and pursuing a career as a physician-scientist, with a focus on global health and infectious diseases.

When I am not sitting in front of my computer trying to make a pretty figure or studying, I can be found hiking, biking or traveling. Once upon a time, I was also a wrestler, which I still love to do from time to time. However, most of my current athletic pursuits involve trying to keep up with my wife, Katelyn Rittenhouse.
