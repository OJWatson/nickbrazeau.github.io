Nick Brazeau grew up in North Carolina and Michigan and is proud to have an accent that makes absolutely no sense. He graduated Harvard College with a bachelor's degree in Human Evolutionary Biology with _Magna Cum Lauda_ distinction. He also completed his undergraduate thesis dissertation on the evolution of chimpanzee growth patterns under the direction of Zarin Machanda and Richard Wrangham, for which he earned Highest Honors and the Thomas T. Hoopes Prize. Following this, Nick spent nine months on a Fulbright Scholarship studying chimpanzees in the Kanyawara forest with the [Kibale Chimpanzee Project](https://kibalechimpanzees.wordpress.com/) prior to matriculating with the University of North Carolina Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD Program).

At UNC, Nick completed his PhD in Epidemiology from the Gillings School of Global Public Health, focusing on infectious diseases. His dissertation work was completed under Jonathan Juliano and the late [Steven Meshnick](https://www.astmh.org/blog/august-2020/in-memoriam-steven-meshnick,-md,-phd,-fastmh) as part of the [IDEEL@UNC](https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/infdis/ideel/) group. The work focused on the molecular, spatial, and genetic distribtuion of malaria in the Democratic Republic of th Congo, alongside a few other locatins and "side projects".

Nick then joined Imperial College as a research associate and soon onboarded onto the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team. His work focused on re-estimating the infection fatality ratio using statistical modeling with a Bayesian approach under the direction of Robert Verity, Lucy Okell, Azra Ghani, and Neil Ferguson.


**Currently, Nick is trying to grow out his white coat (which is currently more consistent with a buzz cut). You can find him wandering the halls of UNC-SOM as a medical student until May 2023.**

When Nick is not sitting in front of a computer trying to make a pretty figure or studying, he can be found hiking, biking or traveling. Once upon a time, he was also a wrestler, which he still loves to do from time to time. However, most of his current athletic pursuits involve trying to keep up with his wife, [Katelyn Rittenhouse](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q6IQT_kAAAAJ&hl=en).
