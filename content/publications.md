## Manuscripts
### Malaria
[The Epidemiology of _P. vivax_ Among Adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: A Cross-Sectional, Nationally-Representative Survey](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34234124/) \
**TL;DR**: _P. vivax_ has long been assumed to be essentially extinct in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this manuscript, we combine techniques from causal inference epidemiolgy, spatial epidemiology, and bioinformatics to describes who is being infected by _P. vivax_ in the DRC, where infections are occurring, and where the infections potentially originated. Overall, we suggest that _P. vivax_ is persisting in the DRC rather than expanding or thriving.  
&nbsp;

[The Impact of Antimalarial Resistance on the Genetic Structure of _Plasmodium falciparum_ in the DRC](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32355199/) \
**TL;DR**: Using a massively parallel amplicon sequencing approach, we used genomic analyses to demonstrate that the DRC appears to be a "mixing pot" for _P. falciparum_ infections across Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, we identified strong signals of selection to antimalarial drugs in the DRC that likely have driven gene flow patterns across the country.
&nbsp;

[Pooled Deep Sequencing of Drug Resistance Loci from _Plasmodium falciparum_ Parasites across Ethiopia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31516103/) \
**TL;DR**: Using samples collected as part of antimalarial drug efficacy studies across Ethiopia over mulitple years, we demonstrated that _P. falciparum_ parasites have evidence of persistence through space and time, despite differing profiles of antimalarial resistance. A main focus of this project was capacity building and increased molecular survelliance capacity at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and was the first project of a lasting collaboration between the EPHI and UNC.  
&nbsp;

[Falciparum malaria from coastal Tanzania and Zanzibar remains highly connected despite effective control efforts on the archipelago](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31992305/) \
**TL;DR**: Signigicant achievements have been made in Zanzibar in reducing the burden of malaria. However, the region has not been able to achieve malaria elimination. We find that despite existing excellent control efforts, there is ample evidence for gene flow and importation between Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. This study highlights the challenges for elimination campaigns in addressing sink-source dynamics and the difficulties of blocking genetic corridors, which in theory should lead to a lack of diversity and ecological collapse of the malaria parasite in regions undergoing elimination.     
&nbsp;

[Plasmodium vivax chloroquine resistance links to pvcrt transcription in a genetic cross](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31541097/) \
**TL;DR**: As part of a large collaboration with the NIH malaria group, we helped to identify the signal of genetic selection for chloroquine resistance among _P. vivax_ parasites as part of a genetic cross. This small piece of analysis was part of the much larger project that combined basic science techniques, anmial models, genomics, transciptomics, and many more techniques.
