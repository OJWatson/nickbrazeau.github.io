Most people call me Nick.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Harvard College with a bachelor's degree in Human Evolutionary Biology with _Magna Cum Lauda_ distinction as well as completing my undergraduate dissertation on the evolution of chimpanzee growth patterns under the direction of Zarin Machanda and Richard Wrangham, for which I earned _Highest Honors_ and the Thomas T. Hoopes Prize. Following this, I spent nine months on a Fulbright Scholarship studying chimpanzees in the Kanyawara forest with the [Kibale Chimpanzee Project](https://kibalechimpanzees.wordpress.com/). I then matriculated with the University of North Carolina Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD Program).

At UNC, I completed my PhD in Epidemiology from the Gillings School of Global Public Health, focusing on infectious diseases. My dissertation work was completed under Jonathan Juliano and the late [Steven Meshnick](https://www.astmh.org/blog/august-2020/in-memoriam-steven-meshnick,-md,-phd,-fastmh), as part of the [IDEEL@UNC](https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/infdis/ideel/) group. The work focused on the molecular, spatial, and genetic distribution  of malaria in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, alongside broader antimalarial resistance and malaria genetic relatedness work.

In 2020, I joined Imperial College London as a research associate and soon onboarded onto the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team. My work focused on re-estimating the infection fatality ratio using statistical modeling with a Bayesian approach under the direction of Robert Verity, Lucy Okell, Azra Ghani, and Neil Ferguson.

As part of being an infectious disease and molecular epidemiologist, I am passionate about statistics (Bayesian methods), mathematical modeling, genomics, bioinformatics/population genetics, molecular epidemiology, and spatial analyses. I am also an MD-trainee applying to the ABIM Research Pathway/Physician Scientist Training Program pathway for Internal Medicine with subspecialty training in Infectious Diseases. In the long-term, I plan on joining these passions and pursuing a career as a physician-scientist, with a focus on global health and infectious diseases.


When I am not sitting in front of my computer trying to make a pretty figure or studying, I can be found hiking, biking or traveling. Once upon a time, I was also a wrestler, which I still love to do from time to time. However, most of my current athletic pursuits involve trying to keep up with my wife, Katelyn Rittenhouse.
