### Infectious Disease Modeling

There are many approaches to modeling infectious diseases depending on the research question. In one framework, I have considered the "who", "where", "why now" of a pathogen in a region that was previously thought to be resilient to infection. To determine "who" was being infected, I estimated "risk factors" accounting for confounding using inverse probability treatment weights estimated through the supervised SuperLearner (machine learning) algorithm; "where" infections were occurring using Bayesian Gaussian spatial process models; and "why now" using basic genetic analyses. For other research questions estimating the severity of an infectious disease, I have employed Bayesian statistical modeling or helped to implement mathematical models for infection scenario and burden planning. As an infectious disease epidemiologist, I am most interested in the intersection of methods, combining molecular techniques, bioinformatics/genomics, evolutionary biology, statistical modeling, and spatial methods to identify pathways of infection and pathways of antimicrobial resistance evolution. Using an interdisciplinary approach, I hope to identify interventions that block these pathways.

### Bioinformatics, Genomics, Statistical Genetics

Molecular surveillance and genomics greatly enrich infectious disease epidemiology analyses, models, and intervention planning. To date, a large majority of my bioinformatic and genomic work has focused on antimicrobial resistance, with an emphasis on putative antimalarial resistance. In the past, I have used genome-wide barcodes to infer how antimalarial selectional pressures have shaped Falciparum malaria population structures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as whole genome sequencing to identify novel antimicrobial mutations in _Staphylococcus epidermidis_. Separately, I have been engaged in statistical genetics method development with models focused on estimating local inbreeding (`DISCent`), important for sink-source dynamics and interventional planning, as well as inferring identity by descent in polyclonal malaria infections (`polyIBD`).

### Global Health & Medicine, Translational Research

Global medicine has become local medicine and vice versa. I am interested in supporting capacity building efforts through research in low- and middle-income countries and historically underserved regions.
