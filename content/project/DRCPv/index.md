 _P. vivax_ has long been assumed to be essentially extinct in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this manuscript, we combine techniques from causal inference epidemiolgy, spatial epidemiology, and bioinformatics to describes who is being infected by _P. vivax_ in the DRC, where infections are occurring, and where the infections potentially originated. Overall, we suggest that _P. vivax_ is persisting in the DRC rather than expanding or thriving. This project was published as Brazeau _et al._ 2021 in Nature Communications[^1].
