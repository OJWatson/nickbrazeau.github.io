Using samples collected as part of antimalarial drug efficacy studies across Ethiopia over multiple years, we demonstrated that _P. falciparum_ parasites have evidence of persistence through space and time, despite differing profiles of antimalarial resistance. A main focus of this project was capacity building and increased molecular surveillance capacity at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and was the first project of a lasting collaboration between the EPHI and UNC. This project was published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygeine[^1].
