In this case study of a patient with _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ bacteremia receiving prolonged antibiotics that developed Daptomycin resistance, we used whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to identify a novel mutation. This project demonstrated the utility in using genomic analysis for the identification and survelliance of putative antimicrobial resistant mutations. This project was published as Brazeau & Levinson _et al._ 2020 in Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health[^1].
