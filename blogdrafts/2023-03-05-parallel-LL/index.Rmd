## Structure
Use the [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets) package, which requires a unique setup: 
1. A "worker" script that is named `_targets.R` by default   
2. A "master" script that calls the worker script   
3. Necessary functions and other dependencies in `R/` and `inst/` or other folders respectively
