The model was originally designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (hence the name) but is broadly applicable.
Accurate inference of the IFR based on serological data is challenging due to a number of factors that can bias estimates away from the true value, including: (1) the delay between infection and death, (2) the dynamical process of seroconversion and seroreversion, (3) potential differences in age-specific attack rates, and (4) serological test characteristics.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://nickbrazeau.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nickbrazeau.github.io/about/</guid><description>Most people call me Nick. I grew up in North Carolina and Michigan and am proud to have an accent that makes absolutely no sense. I graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Human Evolutionary Biology with Magna Cum Lauda distinction as well as completing my undergraduate dissertation on the evolution of chimpanzee growth patterns under the direction of Zarin Machanda and Richard Wrangham, for which I earned Highest Honors and the Thomas T.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://nickbrazeau.github.io/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nickbrazeau.github.io/projects/</guid><description>Interests Evolutionary Medicine Internal Medicine Infectious Diseases Statistical Modeling Population Genetics Spatial Statistics Projects There is always more work to be done: no rest for the wreary!

Manuscripts Malaria The Epidemiology of P. vivax Among Adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: A Cross-Sectional, Nationally-Representative Survey TL;DR: P. vivax has long been assumed to be essentially extinct in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this manuscript, we combine techniques from causal inference epidemiolgy, spatial epidemiology, and bioinformatics to describes who is being infected by P.</description></item></channel></rss>
