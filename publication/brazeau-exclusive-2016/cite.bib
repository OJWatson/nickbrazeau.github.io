 abstract = {The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first 6 months of life. However, the effect of EBF on malaria risk remains unclear. In the present study, 137 EBF infants and 358 non-EBF infants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo were assessed for fever and malaria infections by polymerase chain reaction, at 6 months of age. EBF was associated with a reduced risk of clinical malaria (odds ratio = 0.13; 95% confidence interval = 0.00-0.80), suggesting a protective effect of EBF against malaria.},
