By theory, genetic relatnedness is strictly limited to measure of identity by descent. For a full mathematical overview of the simple model, please see the supplements from Brazeau et al. 2022 in in preperation1.\nBriefly, in the early 1970s, Mal√©cot described a relationship between genetic relatedness and physical distance under the premise that pairs that are far apart are less likely to mate: isolation by distance. Capitalizing on this framework by using measures of identity by descent (IBD), we produce a deme inbreeding spatial coefficient (DISC) for point process data in continuous space. Essentially, this measure estimates the amount of \u0026ldquo;inbreeding\u0026rdquo; or within deme relatedness under the assumption that relatedness between two locations in space can be measured from the average pairwise IBD between those two locations conditional on the physical distance that separates them. Further, we assume that geographic distance is scaled by a migration rate, which is a global parameter among all spatial locations (i.e. the migration rate is assumed to be constant through space). As a result, the model produces a DISC for each spatial location considered (user defined) and an overall migration rate parameter (m). Parameter optimization is achieved with a \u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo; gradient descent algorithm. Given that \u0026ldquo;vanilla\u0026rdquo; gradient descent is used, we recommend running numerous models from a wide of array of start parameters to ensure that your final results are the global maximum and not a local maximum (i.e. a false peak).\nNicholas F Brazeau, in preparation.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":1646838020,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646838020,"objectID":"329bb339a90b83192e88affa5733cbdf","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/project/discent/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T08:00:20-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/discent/","section":"project","summary":"An algorithm for detecting deme inbreeding spatial coefficients from recombining pathogen genetic data","tags":["rpackage","malaria","active"],"title":"`DISCent`: Spatial Inbreeding Estimation","type":"project"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

The age-specific IFR can be quantified using antibody surveys to estimate total infections, but requires consideration of delay-distributions from time from infection to seroconversion, time to death, and time to seroreversion (i.e. antibody waning) alongside serologic test sensitivity and specificity. Previous IFR estimates have not fully propagated uncertainty or accounted for these potential biases, particularly seroreversion. Methods: We built a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates these factors and applied this model to simulated data and 10 serologic studies from different countries. Results: We demonstrate that seroreversion becomes a crucial factor as time accrues but is less important during first-wave, short-term dynamics. We additionally show that disaggregating surveys by regions with higher versus lower disease burden can inform serologic test specificity estimates. The overall IFR in each setting was estimated at 0.49-2.53%. Conclusion: We developed a robust statistical framework to account for full uncertainties in the parameters determining IFR. We provide code for others to apply these methods to further datasets and future epidemics.","tags":["Computational biology and bioinformatics","Respiratory tract diseases"],"title":"Estimating the COVID-19 infection fatality ratio accounting for seroreversion using statistical modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cedar L.

Ensuring access to care, irrespective of COVID-19 status, in winter 2020-2021 is essential. METHODS: An integrated model of hospital capacity planning and epidemiological projections of COVID-19 patients is used to estimate the demand for and resultant spare capacity of ICU beds, staff and ventilators under different epidemic scenarios in France, Germany and Italy across the 2020-2021 winter period. The effect of implementing lockdowns triggered by different numbers of COVID-19 patients in ICUs under varying levels of effectiveness is examined, using a 'dual-demand' (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) patient model. RESULTS: Without sufficient mitigation, we estimate that COVID-19 ICU patient numbers will exceed those seen in the first peak, resulting in substantial capacity deficits, with beds being consistently found to be the most constrained resource. Reactive lockdowns could lead to large improvements in ICU capacity during the winter season, with pressure being most effectively alleviated when lockdown is triggered early and sustained under a higher level of suppression. The success of such interventions also depends on baseline bed numbers and average non-COVID-19 patient occupancy. CONCLUSION: Reductions in capacity deficits under different scenarios must be weighed against the feasibility and drawbacks of further lockdowns. Careful, continuous decision-making by national policymakers will be required across the winter period 2020-2021.","tags":["Communicable Disease Control","COVID-19","epidemiological modelling","Europe","France","Germany","hospital capacity","Humans","intensive care","Intensive Care Units","Italy","non-pharmaceutical interventions","Pandemics","SARS-CoV-2"],"title":"Modelling intensive care unit capacity under different epidemiological scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic in three Western European countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island. METHODS: We used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine rollout. RESULTS: C19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact.","tags":["COVID-19","COVID-19 Vaccines","Humans","Immunization Programs","Indonesia","Modelling","Non-pharmaceutical interventions","SARS-CoV-2","Surveillance","Syndrome","Vaccination","Vaccinations"],"title":"Using syndromic measures of mortality to capture the dynamics of COVID-19 in Java, Indonesia, in the context of vaccination rollout","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra B.

However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extend a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identify optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We find that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for¬†textless¬†20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.","tags":["Aged","COVID-19","COVID-19 Vaccines","Humans","Mathematical model","Models","Theoretical","Optimisation","Public Health","SARS-CoV-2","Vaccination","Vaccination model","Vaccines"],"title":"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: A mathematical modelling analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oliver J.

Little is known about the distribution of ovale malaria and risk factors for infection in areas of high malaria endemicity. METHODS: Using the 2013 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Demographic and Health Survey, we conducted a risk factor analysis for P. ovale infections. We evaluated geographic clustering of infections and speciated to P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri through deep sequencing. RESULTS: Of 18 149 adults tested, we detected 143 prevalent P. ovale infections (prevalence estimate 0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], .59%-.98%). Prevalence ratios (PR) for significant risk factors were: male sex PR‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ2.12 (95% CI, 1.38-3.26), coprevalent P. falciparum PR‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ3.52 (95% CI, 2.06-5.99), and rural residence PR‚ÄÖ=‚ÄÖ2.19 (95% CI, 1.31-3.66). P. ovale was broadly distributed throughout the DRC; an elevated cluster of infections was detected in the south-central region. Speciation revealed P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri circulating throughout the country. CONCLUSIONS: P. ovale persists broadly in the DRC, a high malaria burden country. For successful elimination of all malaria species, P. ovale needs to be on the radar of malaria control programs.","tags":["Adult","amplicon sequencing","Democratic Republic of the Congo","epidemiology","Humans","Malaria","nonfalciparum malaria","Plasmodium ovale","Prevalence"],"title":"Under the Radar: Epidemiology of Plasmodium ovale in the Democratic Republic of the Congo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pierre Nouvellet","Sangeeta Bhatia","Anne Cori","Kylie E.

Mobility data represent an important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27-77%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49-91%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12-48%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial.","tags":["Algorithms","Communicable Disease Control","COVID-19","Global Health","Humans","Models","Theoretical","Pandemics","Physical Distancing","Quarantine","SARS-CoV-2"],"title":"Reduction in mobility and COVID-19 transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica T.

METHODS: From mid-January to March 2020, we extracted publicly available data regarding the spread and control of COVID-19 from 31 provincial health authorities and major media outlets in mainland China. Based on these data, we conducted descriptive analyses of the epidemic in the six most-affected provinces. RESULTS: School closures, travel restrictions, community-level lockdown, and contact tracing were introduced concurrently around late January but subsequent epidemic trends differed among provinces. Compared with Hubei, the other five most-affected provinces reported a lower crude case fatality ratio and proportion of critical and severe hospitalised cases. From March 2020, as the local transmission of COVID-19 declined, switching the focus of measures to the testing and quarantine of inbound travellers may have helped to sustain the control of the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Aggregated indicators of case notifications and severity distributions are essential for monitoring an epidemic. A publicly available database containing these indicators and information regarding control measures is a useful resource for further research and policy planning in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.","tags":["Case fatality ratio","China","Contact","Contact Tracing","Control measure","COVID-19","Databases","Factual","Epidemic","Humans","SARS-CoV-2"],"title":"Database of epidemic trends and control measures during the first wave of COVID-19 in mainland China","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["modeling"],"content":" Talk at the UNC Institute of Global Health and Infectious Disease monthly conference.

We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. FINDINGS: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. INTERPRETATION: Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges.

We jointly model the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework.

We estimate that Rt was only below one in 23 states on 1st June. We also estimate that 3.7% [3.4%-4.0%] of the total population of the US had been infected, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious.

The model was originally designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (hence the name) but is broadly applicable. Accurate inference of the IFR based on serological data is challenging due to a number of factors that can bias estimates away from the true value, including: (1) the delay between infection and death, (2) the dynamical process of seroconversion and seroreversion, (3) potential differences in age-specific attack rates, and (4) serological test characteristics. These delay-distributions and serologic test characteristics are expected to cause both shifts in when deaths are observed as well as when and how many true infections are observed, which will then affect the IFR. The model used in COVIDCurve can be briefly summarized as having two pieces: (1) an infection curve shape that is informed by the shape the of the observed death curve but \u0026ldquo;thrown\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot; backwards in time; (2) a pin or a point on the y-axis that the shape must go through (i.e. a pin to inform the area under the curve, or cumulative infections). This pin is informed by the observed serologic data, accounting for test characteristics (e.g. sensitivity and specificity) as well as the time from infection to seroconversion and seroreversion. Accounting for seroreversion, or the waning of antibodies over time that then produces a false negative test, becomes increasingly important as epidemics progress and/or as daily infections start to contract.\nThe IFR estimates from this model (code repo) were published as Imperial College London COVID-19 Response Team Report 341.

This has led to substantial interest in their \\\"test, trace, isolate\\\" strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities of South Korea's outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to emulate these measures elsewhere. METHODS: We systematically extracted numbers of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases, and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using an established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government sources. RESULTS: We estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, Rt dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI, 1.64-2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June, Rt was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th). Despite less stringent \\\"lockdown\\\" measures, strong social distancing measures were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased, and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly; however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to be important for South Korea's successful outbreak control, other factors including regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed. The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases that are linked to clusters may be more difficult.","tags":["Bayes Theorem","Betacoronavirus","Clinical Laboratory Techniques","Contact tracing","Contact Tracing","Coronavirus Infections","COVID-19","COVID-19 Testing","Disease Outbreaks","Humans","Pandemics","Pneumonia","Viral","Public health interventions","Quarantine","Reproduction number","Republic of Korea","SARS-CoV-2","South Korea"],"title":"Response to COVID-19 in South Korea and implications for lifting stringent interventions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra B.

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. METHODS: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3¬∑0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. INTERPRETATION: Maintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We combine data on demography, contact patterns, disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower-income countries may reduce overall risk, but limited health system capacity coupled with closer intergenerational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower-income countries resulting from the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken suppression to date, lower-income countries have acted earlier. However, this will need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider health, well-being, and economies of these countries.","tags":["Coronavirus Infections","COVID-19","Developing Countries","Global Health","Humans","Pandemics","Patient Acceptance of Health Care","Pneumonia","Viral","Poverty","Public Health"],"title":"The impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression in low- and middle-income countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Molly Deutsch-Feldman","Nicholas F.

In this study, we assessed malaria risk factors among adults using samples from the nationally representative, cross-sectional 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We further explored differences in risk factors by urbanicity. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum infection was determined by PCR. Covariates were drawn from the DHS to model individual, community and environmental-level risk factors for infection. Additionally, we used deep sequencing data to estimate the community-level proportions of drug-resistant infections and included these estimates as potential risk factors. All identified factors were assessed for differences in associations by urbanicity. RESULTS: A total of 16‚Äâ126 adults were included. Overall prevalence of malaria was 30.3% (SE=1.1) by PCR; province-level prevalence ranged from 6.7% to 58.3%. Only 17% of individuals lived in households with at least one bed-net for every two people, as recommended by the WHO. Protective factors included increasing within-household bed-net coverage (Prevalence Ratio=0.85, 95%‚ÄâCI=0.76-0.95) and modern housing (PR=0.58, 95%‚ÄâCI=0.49-0.69). Community-level protective factors included increased median wealth (PR=0.87, 95%‚ÄâCI=0.83-0.92). Education, wealth, and modern housing showed protective associations in cities but not in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The DRC continues to suffer from a high burden of malaria; interventions that target high-risk groups and sustained investment in malaria control are sorely needed. Areas of high prevalence should be prioritised for interventions to target the largest reservoirs for further transmission.","tags":["Adult","Cross-Sectional Studies","cross-sectional survey","Democratic Republic of the Congo","epidemiology","Humans","malaria","Malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","PCR","Plasmodium falciparum"],"title":"Spatial and epidemiological drivers of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["r"],"content":"The goal of polySimIBD is to perform forwards in-time simulation of malaria population genetics.

We sequence 2537 Plasmodium falciparum infections, including a nationally representative population sample from DRC and samples from surrounding countries, using molecular inversion probes - a high-throughput genotyping tool. We identify an east-west divide in haplotypes known to confer resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Furthermore, we identify highly related parasites over large geographic distances, indicative of gene flow and migration. Our results are consistent with a background of isolation by distance combined with the effects of selection for antimalarial drug resistance. This study provides a high-resolution view of parasite genetic structure across a large country in Africa and provides a baseline to study how implementation programs may impact parasite populations.","tags":["Antimalarials","Chloroquine","Democratic Republic of the Congo","Drug Combinations","Drug Resistance","Genome","Protozoan","Genotype","Geography","Haplotypes","Humans","Malaria","Falciparum","Mutation","Plasmodium falciparum","Polymorphism","Single Nucleotide","Principal Component Analysis","Pyrimethamine","Sulfadoxine"],"title":"The impact of antimalarial resistance on the genetic structure of Plasmodium falciparum in the DRC","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Jeffrey","Caroline E.

Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths. Results: We show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister's announcement of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility.

Despite consistent implementation of effective tools since 2002, elimination has not been achieved. Importation of parasites from outside of the archipelago is thought to be an important cause of malaria's persistence, but this paradigm has not been studied using modern genetic tools. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate the impact of importation, employing population genetic analyses of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from both the archipelago and mainland Tanzania. Ancestry, levels of genetic diversity and differentiation, patterns of relatedness, and patterns of selection between these two populations were assessed by leveraging recent advances in deconvolution of genomes from polyclonal malaria infections. RESULTS: Significant decreases in the effective population sizes were inferred in both populations that coincide with a period of decreasing malaria transmission in Tanzania. Identity by descent analysis showed that parasites in the two populations shared long segments of their genomes, on the order of 5¬†cM, suggesting shared ancestry within the last 10 generations. Even with limited sampling, two of isolates between the mainland and Zanzibar were identified that are related at the expected level of half-siblings, consistent with recent importation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that importation plays an important role for malaria incidence on Zanzibar and demonstrate the value of genomic approaches for identifying corridors of parasite movement to the island.","tags":["Cohort Studies","Demography","Gene Library","Genetic Variation","Haploidy","Haplotypes","Humans","Incidence","Islands","Malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","Mutation","Plasmodium","Plasmodium falciparum","Population genetics","Tanzania","Travel","Whole Genome Sequencing"],"title":"Falciparum malaria from coastal Tanzania and Zanzibar remains highly connected despite effective control efforts on the archipelago","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

Among all sites, the kelch13 gene showed no mutations, whereas the pfcrt CVIET genotype was fixed in all populations. By contrast, the mdr1 gene demonstrated frequencies of resistant genotypes ranging from 10 to 100% at amino acid position 86 and from 0% to 57.8% at amino acid position 1246.

This study explores longitudinal changes in spatial patterns to understand how resistant malaria may be spreading within the DRC, using samples from nation-wide population-representative surveys. METHODS: We selected 552 children with PCR-detectable Plasmodium falciparum infection and identified known variants in the pfdhps and pfcrt genes associated with resistance. We compared the proportion of mutant parasites in 2013 to those previously reported from adults in 2007, and identified risk factors for carrying a resistant allele using multivariate mixed-effects modeling. Finally, we fit a spatial-temporal model to the observed data, providing smooth allele frequency estimates over space and time. RESULTS: The proportion of co-occurring pfdhps K540E/A581G mutations increased by 16% between 2007 and 2013. The spatial-temporal model suggests that the spatial range of the pfdhps double mutants expanded over time, while the prevalence and range of pfcrt mutations remained steady. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses population-representative samples to describe the changing landscape of SP resistance within the DRC, and the persistence of chloroquine resistance. Vigilant molecular surveillance is critical for controlling the spread of resistance.","tags":["Adolescent","Adult","Alcohol Dehydrogenase","Antimalarials","Chloroquine","Cross-Sectional Studies","Democratic Republic of the Congo","Drug Combinations","Drug resistance","Drug Resistance","Gene Frequency","Humans","Longitudinal Studies","Malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","Membrane Transport Proteins","Middle Aged","Mutation","Plasmodium falciparum","Prevalence","Protozoan Proteins","Pyrimethamine","Spatial-temporal modeling","Spatio-Temporal Analysis","Sulfadoxine","Young Adult"],"title":"The changing landscape of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance in the Democratic Republic of Congo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juliana M.

Four P. vivax infections were identified by polymerase chain reaction, each in a geographically different survey cluster. Using these as index cases, we tested the remaining 73 samples from the four clusters. With this approach, 10 confirmed cases, three probable cases, and one possible case of P. vivax were identified. Among the 14 P. vivax cases, nine were coinfected with Plasmodium falciparum. All 14 individuals were confirmed to be Duffy-negative by sequencing for the single point mutation in the GATA motif that represses the expression of the Duffy antigen. This finding is consistent with a growing body of literature that suggests that P. vivax can infect Duffy-negative individuals in Africa.

Shared medical appointments (SMA) have been shown to improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the SMA model could be adapted for a non-profit clinic in North Carolina that serves uninsured patients with diabetes that have incomes at/below 150% of the federal poverty line. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We implemented and sustained a patient-driven, student-led SMA model that incorporated the monthly rotations of students, physician assistant, and undergraduate students as well as pharmacy residents and an endocrinologist who collectively provide diabetes care at the free clinic. SMA groups are 'open' cohorts and include 4-12 patients scheduled for the monthly clinic. Teams of transdisciplinary trainees work together to perform triage, medication reconciliation, brief history, and physical exam, after which patients participate in the SMA. The endocrinologist evaluates SMA patients individually during and after the visit. RESULTS: Between November 2015 and January 2017, we enrolled 29 patients in SMA. There was high variability in HbA1c at baseline. Among eight type 2 diabetes patients seen in endocrine clinic and with complete data one year before and after SMA implementation, the mean (SD) HbA1c before SMA was 9.7% ¬± 1.7% (83¬±7 mmol/ mol); mean HbA1c after SMA was 9.2% ¬± 1.8% (77 ¬± 8mmol/mol). The median HbA1c before SMA was 9.5% (80 mmol/mol); median HbA1c after SMA was 8.9% (74 mmol/mol). Overall, 6/8 patients showed decreased HbA1c after SMA although there was variability between individuals in response of glycemic control to SMA. SMA increased clinic efficiency and offered an opportunity to integrate transdisciplinary trainees. Trainees gain experience with novel models of care and the complexities of the patient experience of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: We hope this observation encourages others to implement such programs to enhance the evidence-base for SMA to address health disparities and increase the quality of free diabetes care.","tags":["Free clinic","Interdisciplinary","Shared medical appointments","Type 2 diabetes"],"title":"Implementation and Evaluation of Shared Medical Appointments for Type 2 Diabetes at a Free, Student-Run Clinic in Alamance County, North Carolina","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["vivax","genomics"],"content":" Oral presentation at the annual American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conference analyzing the genomics of P. vivax relapses from Cambodia.\n","date":1510156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510156800,"objectID":"23493912b397aecc1270748bb2e356fd","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/talk/pvrelapse-astmh/","publishdate":"2020-12-18T08:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/pvrelapse-astmh/","section":"talk","summary":"Oral presentation at the annual American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conference analyzing the genomics of P. vivax relapses from Cambodia.","tags":["malaria"],"title":"Whole Genome Analysis of Polyclonal Plasmodium vivax Relapses in Cambodia","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Christian M.

We investigated the genetic architecture of 78 falciparum isolates using whole-genome sequencing, correlating results to in vivo and ex vivo drug resistance and exploring the relationship between population structure, demographic history, and partner drug resistance. Principle component analysis, network analysis and demographic inference identified a diverse central population with three clusters of clonally expanding parasite populations, each associated with specific K13 artemisinin resistance alleles and partner drug resistance profiles which were consistent with the sequential deployment of artemisinin combination therapies in the region. One cluster displayed ex vivo piperaquine resistance and mefloquine sensitivity with a high rate of in vivo failure of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Another cluster displayed ex vivo mefloquine resistance and piperaquine sensitivity with high in vivo efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The final cluster was clonal and displayed intermediate sensitivity to both drugs. Variations in recently described piperaquine resistance markers did not explain the difference in mean IC90 or clinical failures between the high and intermediate piperaquine resistance groups, suggesting additional loci may be involved in resistance. The results highlight an important role for partner drug resistance in shaping the P. falciparum genetic landscape in Southeast Asia and suggest that further work is needed to evaluate for other mutations that drive piperaquine resistance.","tags":["ACT","Adult","Antipruritics","Artemisinins","Cambodia","drug resistance","Drug Resistance","ex vivo susceptibility","Female","Humans","kelch","malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","Male","mefloquine","Mefloquine","partner drug","pfmdr1","Phylogeny","piperaquine","plasmodium","Plasmodium falciparum","population genetics","Protozoan Proteins","Quinolines","Treatment Failure"],"title":"Partner-Drug Resistance and Population Substructuring of Artemisinin-Resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

Palm-to-palm clasping (PPC) is a distinct style of high-arm grooming in which the¬†grooming partners clasp each other's raised palms. In wild communities, samples of at least 100 observed dyads grooming with raised hands showed PPC frequencies varying from textless5% (M group, Mahale) to textgreater30% dyads grooming (Kanyawara, Kibale), and in a large free-ranging sanctuary group, the frequency reached textgreater80% dyads (group 1, Chimfunshi) [1, 2]. Because between-community differences in¬†frequency of PPC apparently result from social learning, are stable across generations, and last for at least 9 years, they are thought to be cultural, but¬†the mechanism of transmission is unknown [2]. Here, we examine factors responsible for individual variation in PPC frequency within a single wild community. We found that in the Kanyawara community (Kibale, Uganda), adults of both sexes varied widely in their PPC frequency (from textless10% to textgreater50%) and did not converge on a central group tendency. However, frequencies of PPC were highly consistent within matrilines, indicating that individuals maintained lifelong fidelity to the grooming style of their mothers. Matrilineal inheritance of socially learned behaviors has previously been reported for tool use in chimpanzees [3] and in the vocal and feeding behavior of cetaceans [4, 5]. Our evidence indicates that matrilineal inheritance can be sufficiently strong in nonhuman primates to account for long-term differences in community traditions.","tags":["Animals","behavioral diffusion","conformity","conservatism","Female","Grooming","hand-clasp grooming","high-arm grooming","Male","palm-to-palm clasp","Pan troglodytes","Social Behavior","Social Learning","social tradition","transmission bias","Uganda"],"title":"Distribution of a Chimpanzee Social Custom Is Explained by Matrilineal Relationship Rather Than Conformity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

Understanding the allele frequencies of polymorphisms in critical binding regions of antigens can help in the designing of strain-transcendent vaccines. Here, we adopt a pooled deep-sequencing approach, originally designed to study P. falciparum drug resistance mutations, to study the diversity of two leading transmission-blocking vaccine candidates, Pfs25 and Pfs48/45. We sequenced 329 P. falciparum field isolates from six different geographic regions. Pfs25 showed little diversity, with only one known polymorphism identified in the region associated with binding of transmission-blocking antibodies among our isolates. However, we identified four new mutations among eight non-synonymous mutations within the presumed antibody-binding region of Pfs48/45. Pooled deep sequencing provides a scalable and cost-effective approach for the targeted study of allele frequencies of P. falciparum candidate vaccine antigens.","tags":["Antigens","Protozoan","DNA","Protozoan","Genetic Variation","Haplotypes","Malaria Vaccines","Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques","Plasmodium falciparum"],"title":"Pooled Amplicon Deep Sequencing of Candidate Plasmodium falciparum Transmission-Blocking Vaccine Antigens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zarin Machanda","Nick F.

However, recent studies of wild ape dentitions have cast doubt on the use of developmental standards derived from captive individuals. Others have called into question the use of deceased wild individuals to infer normative development. We conducted a high resolution photographic study of living known-age subadults in the Kanyawara community (Kibale National Park, Uganda) to generate a comprehensive three year record of dental eruption (including tooth emergence ages). These non-invasive data allow comparisons of captive and wild chimpanzees, establish accurate developmental standards for relatively healthy wild individuals, and facilitate direct assessments of primate-wide associations between dental development and life history. Emergence ages in the Kanyawara chimpanzees are very similar to living Gombe chimpanzees, and are broadly comparable to deceased Ta√Ø Forest chimpanzees. Early-emerging teeth such as the deciduous dentition and first molar (M1) appear during a time of maternal dependence, and are almost indistinguishable from captive chimpanzee emergence ages, while later forming teeth in the Kanyawara population emerge in the latter half of captive age ranges or beyond. Five juveniles whose lower M1s emerged by or before 3.3 years of age continued to nurse for a year or more beyond M1 emergence, and their mothers showed considerable variation in reproductive rates. The third molars of two adolescent females emerged several months to several years prior to the birth of their first offspring. Given that broad primate-wide relationships between molar emergence and life history do not necessarily hold within this population of chimpanzees, particularly for variables that are reported to be coincident with molar emergence, we suggest that further study is required in order to predict life history variables in hominins or hominoids.","tags":["Adaptation","Physiological","Africa","Eastern","Aging","Animals","Biological Evolution","Dental development","Female","Human evolution","Life history","Male","Molar","Pan troglodytes","Tooth emergence","Tooth Eruption","Weaning"],"title":"Dental eruption in East African wild chimpanzees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

We identified a subset of patients who underwent contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging of the pelvis six months before or anytime after the MRV and did not undergo any interventional venous procedures between the two studies; 36 patients met these criteria. The degree of venous compression was calculated in both the index and comparison study. RESULTS: On the index MRV, the mean compression of the LCIV was 62%. However, on the comparison study in the same patients, the mean compression was 39%. The mean change in degree of compression between the two studies was 23% (P textless 0.0001), ranging from a 12% increase to 69% decrease in degree of compression on the comparison study. CONCLUSION: The compressed LCIV on a single MRV study was not stable over time and thus may be insufficient to diagnose May-Thurner syndrome.","tags":["Adult","Aged","Aged","80 and over","Diagnosis","Differential","Female","Humans","Iliac Artery","Iliac Vein","Magnetic Resonance Angiography","Male","May-Thurner Syndrome","Middle Aged","Phlebography","Reproducibility of Results","Retrospective Studies","Tomography","X-Ray Computed","Young Adult"],"title":"May-Thurner syndrome: can it be diagnosed by a single MR venography study?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["r"],"content":"Briefly, the primary objective of this project was to identify methods that disrupt and/or enhance the predictability of infectious disease dynamics (IDD) of emerging outbreaks.

Our focus on contact networks is based on the assumption that transmission parameters can be readily measured early in an epidemic. As a result, while contact patterns are difficult to measure, they are the pragmatic force driving uncertainty in the predictions of outbreak sizes.
