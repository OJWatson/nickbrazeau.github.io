The age-specific IFR can be quantified using antibody surveys to estimate total infections, but requires consideration of delay-distributions from time from infection to seroconversion, time to death, and time to seroreversion (i.e. antibody waning) alongside serologic test sensitivity and specificity. Previous IFR estimates have not fully propagated uncertainty or accounted for these potential biases, particularly seroreversion. Methods: We built a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates these factors and applied this model to simulated data and 10 serologic studies from different countries. Results: We demonstrate that seroreversion becomes a crucial factor as time accrues but is less important during first-wave, short-term dynamics. We additionally show that disaggregating surveys by regions with higher versus lower disease burden can inform serologic test specificity estimates. The overall IFR in each setting was estimated at 0.49-2.53%. Conclusion: We developed a robust statistical framework to account for full uncertainties in the parameters determining IFR. We provide code for others to apply these methods to further datasets and future epidemics.","tags":["Computational biology and bioinformatics","Respiratory tract diseases"],"title":"Estimating the COVID-19 infection fatality ratio accounting for seroreversion using statistical modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cedar L.

Ensuring access to care, irrespective of COVID-19 status, in winter 2020-2021 is essential. METHODS: An integrated model of hospital capacity planning and epidemiological projections of COVID-19 patients is used to estimate the demand for and resultant spare capacity of ICU beds, staff and ventilators under different epidemic scenarios in France, Germany and Italy across the 2020-2021 winter period. The effect of implementing lockdowns triggered by different numbers of COVID-19 patients in ICUs under varying levels of effectiveness is examined, using a 'dual-demand' (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) patient model. RESULTS: Without sufficient mitigation, we estimate that COVID-19 ICU patient numbers will exceed those seen in the first peak, resulting in substantial capacity deficits, with beds being consistently found to be the most constrained resource. Reactive lockdowns could lead to large improvements in ICU capacity during the winter season, with pressure being most effectively alleviated when lockdown is triggered early and sustained under a higher level of suppression. The success of such interventions also depends on baseline bed numbers and average non-COVID-19 patient occupancy. CONCLUSION: Reductions in capacity deficits under different scenarios must be weighed against the feasibility and drawbacks of further lockdowns. Careful, continuous decision-making by national policymakers will be required across the winter period 2020-2021.","tags":["Communicable Disease Control","COVID-19","epidemiological modelling","Europe","France","Germany","hospital capacity","Humans","intensive care","Intensive Care Units","Italy","non-pharmaceutical interventions","Pandemics","SARS-CoV-2"],"title":"Modelling intensive care unit capacity under different epidemiological scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic in three Western European countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

In Java, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented throughout 2020. However, as a vaccination campaign launches, cases and deaths are rising across the island. METHODS: We used modelling to explore the extent to which data on burials in Jakarta using strict COVID-19 protocols (C19P) provide additional insight into the transmissibility of the disease, epidemic trajectory, and the impact of NPIs. We assess how implementation of NPIs in early 2021 will shape the epidemic during the period of likely vaccine rollout. RESULTS: C19P burial data in Jakarta suggest a death toll approximately 3.3 times higher than reported. Transmission estimates using these data suggest earlier, larger, and more sustained impact of NPIs. Measures to reduce sub-national spread, particularly during Ramadan, substantially mitigated spread to more vulnerable rural areas. Given current trajectory, daily cases and deaths are likely to increase in most regions as the vaccine is rolled out. Transmission may peak in early 2021 in Jakarta if current levels of control are maintained. However, relaxation of control measures is likely to lead to a subsequent resurgence in the absence of an effective vaccination campaign. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic measures of mortality provide a more complete picture of COVID-19 severity upon which to base decision-making. The high potential impact of the vaccine in Java is attributable to reductions in transmission to date and dependent on these being maintained. Increases in control in the relatively short-term will likely yield large, synergistic increases in vaccine impact.","tags":["COVID-19","COVID-19 Vaccines","Humans","Immunization Programs","Indonesia","Modelling","Non-pharmaceutical interventions","SARS-CoV-2","Surveillance","Syndrome","Vaccination","Vaccinations"],"title":"Using syndromic measures of mortality to capture the dynamics of COVID-19 in Java, Indonesia, in the context of vaccination rollout","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra B.

However, the doses available in 2021 are likely to be limited. We extend a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission across different country settings to evaluate the public health impact of potential vaccines using WHO-developed target product profiles. We identify optimal vaccine allocation strategies within- and between-countries to maximise averted deaths under constraints on dose supply. We find that the health impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination depends on the cumulative population-level infection incidence when vaccination begins, the duration of natural immunity, the trajectory of the epidemic prior to vaccination, and the level of healthcare available to effectively treat those with disease. Within a country we find that for a limited supply (doses for textless 20% of the population) the optimal strategy is to target the elderly. However, with a larger supply, if vaccination can occur while other interventions are maintained, the optimal strategy switches to targeting key transmitters to indirectly protect the vulnerable. As supply increases, vaccines that reduce or block infection have a greater impact than those that prevent disease alone due to the indirect protection provided to high-risk groups. Given a 2 billion global dose supply in 2021, we find that a strategy in which doses are allocated to countries proportional to population size is close to optimal in averting deaths and aligns with the ethical principles agreed in pandemic preparedness planning.","tags":["Aged","COVID-19","COVID-19 Vaccines","Humans","Mathematical model","Models","Theoretical","Optimisation","Public Health","SARS-CoV-2","Vaccination","Vaccination model","Vaccines"],"title":"Within-country age-based prioritisation, global allocation, and public health impact of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: A mathematical modelling analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oliver J.

We evaluated geographic clustering of infections and speciated to P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri through deep sequencing. RESULTS: Of 18 149 adults tested, we detected 143 prevalent P. ovale infections (prevalence estimate 0.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], .59%-.98%). Prevalence ratios (PR) for significant risk factors were: male sex PR = 2.12 (95% CI, 1.38-3.26), coprevalent P. falciparum PR = 3.52 (95% CI, 2.06-5.99), and rural residence PR = 2.19 (95% CI, 1.31-3.66). P. ovale was broadly distributed throughout the DRC; an elevated cluster of infections was detected in the south-central region. Speciation revealed P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri circulating throughout the country. CONCLUSIONS: P. ovale persists broadly in the DRC, a high malaria burden country.

Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27-77%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49-91%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12-48%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial.","tags":["Algorithms","Communicable Disease Control","COVID-19","Global Health","Humans","Models","Theoretical","Pandemics","Physical Distancing","Quarantine","SARS-CoV-2"],"title":"Reduction in mobility and COVID-19 transmission","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica T.

The squire model was developed as part of the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team and has been key in a number of our COVID-19 projects and publications to date, including:\nThis is a brief overview of the model, which is fully described at https://github.com/mrc-ide/squire\nOverview squire is a package enabling users to quickly and easily generate calibrated estimates of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories under different control scenarios. It consists of the following:\nAn age-structured SEIR model incorporating explicit passage through healthcare settings and explicit progression through disease severity stages. The ability to calibrate the model to different epidemic start-dates based on available death data. Simulate the impacts of different control interventions (including general social distancing, specific shielding of elderly populations, and more stringent suppression strategies). If you are new to squire, the best place to start is below, where we detail how to install the package, how to set up the model, and how to run it with and without control interventions.\nModel Structure Overall Structure squire uses an age-structured SEIR model, with the infectious class divided into different stages reflecting progression through different disease severity pathways. These compartments are:\n* S = Susceptibles\n* E = Exposed (Latent Infection)\n* IMild = Mild Infections (Not Requiring Hospitalisation)\n* ICase = Infections Requiring Hospitalisation\n* IHospital = Hospitalised (Requires Hospital Bed)\n* IICU = ICU (Requires ICU Bed)\n* IRec = Recovering from ICU Stay (Requires Hospital Bed)\n* R = Recovered\n* D = Dead\nDecision Trees for Healthcare Capacity Given initial inputs of hospital/ICU bed capacity and the average time cases spend in hospital, the model dynamically tracks available hospital and ICU beds over time.\nIndividuals newly requiring hospitalisation (either a hospital or ICU bed) are then assigned to either receive care (if the relevant bed is available) or not (if maximum capacity would be exceeded otherwise). Whether or not an individual receives the required care modifies their probability of dying.\nInstallation squire utilises the package odin to generate the model. odin implements a high-level language for implementing mathematical models and can be installed by running the following command:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;odin\u0026quot;) The model generated using odin is written in C and so you will require a compiler to install dependencies for the package and to build any models with odin. Windows users should install Rtools. See the relevant section in R-admin for advice. Be sure to select the “edit PATH” checkbox during installation or the tools will not be found.\nThe function odin::can_compile() will check if it is able to compile things, but by the time you install the package that will probably have been satisfied.\nAfter installation of odin, ensure you have the devtools package installed by running the following:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;devtools\u0026quot;) Then install the squire package directly from GitHub by running:\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;mrc-ide/squire\u0026quot;) If you have any problems installing then please raise an issue on the squire GitHub.\nIf everything has installed correctly, we then need to load the package:\nlibrary(squire) Getting Started Running the Model (Unmitigated) 1. Running the model using baseline parameters and no control interventions The full model is referred to as the explicit_SEEIR model, with hospital pathways explicitly exploring whether individuals will require a general hospital bed providing oxygen or an ICU bed that provides ventilation.\nTo run the model we need to provide at least one of the following arguments:\ncountry population and contact_matrix_set If the country is provided, the population and contact_matrix_set will be generated (if not also specified) using the demographics and matrices specified in the global report.\nTo run the model by providing the country we use run_explicit_SEEIR_model():\nr \u0026lt;- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(country = \u0026quot;Afghanistan\u0026quot;, replicates = 5) The returned object is a squire_simulation object, which is a list of two ojects:\noutput - model output parameters - model parameters squire_simulation objects can be plotted as follows:\nplot(r) #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r): Summary statistic estimated from \u0026lt;10 #\u0026gt; replicates #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r): Confidence bounds estimated from \u0026lt;10 #\u0026gt; replicates #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. This plot will plot each of the compartments of the model output. We can also plot specific compartments using the var_select argument that can be passed to plot(). Arguments passed to var_select must be one of the variables in the plot above.\nplot(r, var_select = c(\u0026quot;E\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IMild\u0026quot;)) #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = c(\u0026quot;E\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IMild\u0026quot;)): Summary #\u0026gt; statistic estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = c(\u0026quot;E\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;IMild\u0026quot;)): Confidence #\u0026gt; bounds estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. Or, you can specify one of deaths, infections, hospital_occupancy, ICU_occupancy, hospital_demand or ICU_demand, and plot these summary metrics that represent the combination of a number of different compartment e.g:\nplot(r, var_select = \u0026quot;deaths\u0026quot;) #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = \u0026quot;deaths\u0026quot;): Summary statistic #\u0026gt; estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = \u0026quot;deaths\u0026quot;): Confidence bounds #\u0026gt; estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. All of the plotting above makes uses of the squire function format_output which provides you with a means of manipulating and managing the output from a run_explicit_SEEIR_model call. Using it you can specify the model outputs (e.g. compartments) you want, as well as whether you want that output aggregated over age or not. Here we extract the latent compartment (E). The data columns correspond to the compartment name (compartment), timestep (t), model run number (replicate) and the model output (y).\noutput \u0026lt;- format_output(r, var_select = \u0026quot;E\u0026quot;) head(output) #\u0026gt; # A tibble: 6 × 4 #\u0026gt; replicate compartment t y #\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; 1 1 E 0.1 20 #\u0026gt; 2 1 E 0.2 20 #\u0026gt; 3 1 E 0.3 20 #\u0026gt; 4 1 E 0.4 20 #\u0026gt; 5 1 E 0.5 20 #\u0026gt; 6 1 E 0.6 20 If we wanted age-disaggregated data, we could set reduce_age to FALSE which will generate the same dataframe as before, but with an additional column indicating the age-group.\noutput \u0026lt;- format_output(r, var_select = \u0026quot;E\u0026quot;, reduce_age = FALSE) head(output) #\u0026gt; # A tibble: 6 × 5 #\u0026gt; replicate age_group compartment t y #\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; 1 1 1 E 0.1 0 #\u0026gt; 2 1 1 E 0.2 0 #\u0026gt; 3 1 1 E 0.3 0 #\u0026gt; 4 1 1 E 0.4 0 #\u0026gt; 5 1 1 E 0.5 0 #\u0026gt; 6 1 1 E 0.6 0 2. Changing parameters in the model. The model has a number of parameters for setting the R0, demography, contact matrices, the durations of each compartment and the health care outcomes and healthcare availability. In addition, the initial state of the population can be changed as well as simulation parameters, such as the number of replicates, length of simulation and the timestep. For a full list of model inputs, please see the function documentation\nFor example, changing the initial R0 (default = 3), number of replicates ( default = 10), simulation length (default = 365 days) and time step (default = 0.5 days), as well as setting the population and contact matrix manually:\n# Get the population pop \u0026lt;- get_population(\u0026quot;United Kingdom\u0026quot;) population \u0026lt;- pop$n # Get the mixing matrix contact_matrix \u0026lt;- get_mixing_matrix(\u0026quot;United Kingdom\u0026quot;) # run the model r \u0026lt;- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, contact_matrix_set = contact_matrix, R0 = 2.5, time_period = 200, dt = 0.1, replicates = 5) plot(r) #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r): Summary statistic estimated from \u0026lt;10 #\u0026gt; replicates #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r): Confidence bounds estimated from \u0026lt;10 #\u0026gt; replicates #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. We can also change the R0 and contact matrix at set time points, to reflect changing behaviour resulting from interventions. For example to set an 80% reduction in the contact matrix after 100 days :\n# run the model r \u0026lt;- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, tt_contact_matrix = c(0, 100), contact_matrix_set = list(contact_matrix, contact_matrix*0.2), R0 = 2.5, time_period = 200, dt = 0.1, replicates = 5) plot(r, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;) #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;): Summary #\u0026gt; statistic estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;): Confidence #\u0026gt; bounds estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. where n_E2_I is the daily number of new infections.\nTo show an 80% reduction after 80 days but only maintained for 40 days :\n# run the model r \u0026lt;- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, tt_contact_matrix = c(0, 80, 120), contact_matrix_set = list(contact_matrix, contact_matrix*0.2, contact_matrix), R0 = 2.5, time_period = 220, dt = 0.1, replicates = 5) plot(r, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;) #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;): Summary #\u0026gt; statistic estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;): Confidence #\u0026gt; bounds estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. Alternatively, we could set a changing R0, which falls below 1 after 80 days:\n# run the model r \u0026lt;- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, contact_matrix_set = contact_matrix, tt_R0 = c(0, 80), R0 = c(2.5, 0.9), time_period = 200, dt = 0.1, replicates = 5) plot(r, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;) #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;): Summary #\u0026gt; statistic estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning in plot.squire_simulation(r, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;): Confidence #\u0026gt; bounds estimated from \u0026lt;10 replicates #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. The model in squire also allows you to alter healthcare capacity. Default values for the arguments hosp_bed_capacity and ICU_capacity are taken from the World Bank and a systematic review of the literature. However, you can also specify your own:\nlibrary(patchwork) r \u0026lt;- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(population = population, contact_matrix_set = contact_matrix, R0 = 2.5, time_period = 200, dt = 0.1, replicates = 15, hosp_bed_capacity = 1000, ICU_bed_capacity = 100) c \u0026lt;- plot(r, var_select = \u0026quot;hospital_occupancy\u0026quot;) d \u0026lt;- plot(r, var_select = \u0026quot;ICU_occupancy\u0026quot;) c / d #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. #\u0026gt; It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. 3. Extracting and Plotting Relevant Outputs Whilst the above provides quick and easy ways to plot relevant outputs, we recognise users might want to play around with the data themselves. This can be done with the format_output function.\nlibrary(ggplot2) library(patchwork) library(dplyr) #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; Attaching package: \u0026#39;dplyr\u0026#39; #\u0026gt; The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:stats\u0026#39;: #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; filter, lag #\u0026gt; The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;: #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; intersect, setdiff, setequal, union x \u0026lt;- run_explicit_SEEIR_model(country = \u0026quot;Afghanistan\u0026quot;, hosp_bed_capacity = 500, ICU_bed_capacity = 200) deaths \u0026lt;- format_output(x = x, var_select = \u0026quot;deaths\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(replicate = factor(replicate)) a \u0026lt;- ggplot(deaths, aes(x = t, y = y, col = replicate)) + geom_line() + ylab(\u0026quot;Daily Deaths\u0026quot;) infections \u0026lt;- format_output(x = x, var_select = \u0026quot;infections\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(replicate = factor(replicate)) b \u0026lt;- ggplot(infections, aes(x = t, y = y, col = replicate)) + geom_line() + ylab(\u0026quot;Daily Infections\u0026quot;) hosp_bed \u0026lt;- format_output(x = x, var_select = \u0026quot;hospital_occupancy\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(replicate = factor(replicate)) c \u0026lt;- ggplot(hosp_bed, aes(x = t, y = y, col = replicate)) + geom_line() + ylab(\u0026quot;Hospital Bed Occupancy\u0026quot;) ICU_bed \u0026lt;- format_output(x = x, var_select = \u0026quot;ICU_occupancy\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% mutate(replicate = factor(replicate)) d \u0026lt;- ggplot(ICU_bed, aes(x = t, y = y, col = replicate)) + geom_line() + ylab(\u0026quot;ICU Bed Occupancy\u0026quot;) z \u0026lt;- a + b + c + d + plot_layout(guides = \u0026#39;collect\u0026#39;) z Hospital bed occupancy fluctuates very slightly above the user-specified number of hospital beds available (+1 in the above example). This is due to individuals being discharged from ICU beds into general hospital beds when general hospital bed occupancy is already at maximum capacity.\nWe assume that these individuals newly discharged from the ICU would in reality be prioritised to receive general hospital beds and so give them a general hospital bed. Whilst this is now shown in the above panel of hospital bed occupancy, this means that less-sick individuals in general hospital beds would be discharged slightly early to make space. We assume that for these small number of the healthiest individuals in hospital, there is no excess mortality associated with this early discharge.\nFuture work will explore a range of bed-prioritisation structures to consider how results might be shaped by who gets a bed and when.\n4. Calibrating the Model to Observed Deaths Data The model can be simply calibrated to time series of deaths reported in settings. This can be done using the calibrate function. For example, let’s use the time series of deaths in Algeria up to the 22nd April 2020:\ndf \u0026lt;- read.csv(squire:::squire_file(\u0026quot;extdata/example_DZA.csv\u0026quot;), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) head(df) #\u0026gt; X date deaths cases #\u0026gt; 1 1 2020-02-26T00:00:00Z 0 1 #\u0026gt; 2 2 2020-03-01T00:00:00Z 0 2 #\u0026gt; 3 3 2020-03-04T00:00:00Z 0 2 #\u0026gt; 4 4 2020-03-05T00:00:00Z 0 7 #\u0026gt; 5 5 2020-03-06T00:00:00Z 0 5 #\u0026gt; 6 6 2020-03-09T00:00:00Z 0 3 We can calibrate the model to this data. This calibration will infer the most likely start date of the epidemic and the R0 at the start of the epidemic. Calibration occurs by scanning across a range of possible R0 values and start dates. Fitting works using a particle filter, which can be parallelised using future::plan(future::multiprocess()) before running calibrate.\n# set up for parallelisation future::plan(future::multiprocess()) # Fit model out \u0026lt;- calibrate( data = df, R0_min = 2, R0_max = 4, R0_step = 0.5, first_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-02-10\u0026quot;, last_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-02-22\u0026quot;, day_step = 4, replicates = 10, n_particles = 20, country = \u0026quot;Algeria\u0026quot; ) calibrate returns the same output as run_explicit_SEEIR_model, with the first three elements in out being the simulation outputs, the model and model parameters. Note that simulation replicates are aligned to the maximum date in the data provided, and as a result we can use the same plotting functions as before:\nplot(out, \u0026quot;deaths\u0026quot;, date_0 = max(df$date), x_var = \u0026quot;date\u0026quot;) #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. With default parameters, calibrate will simulate up to the maximum date in the data provided. The fit to this data can be shown using the plotting function and specifying particle_fit to be TRUE\nplot(out, particle_fit = TRUE) We can see that this is not the best fit, capturing only the beginning of the data points. We can also diagnose the fitting further by looking at the scan_results of the grid search.\nplot(out$scan_results) This grid shows the negative log likeihood for each parameter pair. We can also plot the related probability for each pair as follows:\nplot(out$scan_results, what = \u0026quot;probability\u0026quot;) The reason for the poor fits to the data shown earlier is because Algeria has implemented interventions prior to today. These can also be incorporated into calibrate. For example, we can grab the assumed changes to transmission based on government intervention for Algeria.\ninterventions \u0026lt;- read.csv(squire:::squire_file(\u0026quot;extdata/example_DZA_intervention.csv\u0026quot;)) int_unique \u0026lt;- squire:::interventions_unique(interventions) int_unique #\u0026gt; $dates_change #\u0026gt; [1] \u0026quot;2020-03-12\u0026quot; \u0026quot;2020-03-18\u0026quot; \u0026quot;2020-03-22\u0026quot; \u0026quot;2020-03-23\u0026quot; #\u0026gt; #\u0026gt; $change #\u0026gt; [1] 0.900 0.850 0.550 0.225 We can then provide these to calibrate as the dates (date_R0_change) and relative reductions to R0 (R0_change). We will also specify for model fits to be continued for 14 days into the future with forceast = 14:\nout \u0026lt;- calibrate( data = df, R0_min = 2, R0_max = 4, R0_step = 0.5, first_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-02-10\u0026quot;, last_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-02-22\u0026quot;, day_step = 4, replicates = 10, n_particles = 20, forecast = 14, R0_change = int_unique$change, date_R0_change = int_unique$dates_change, country = \u0026quot;Algeria\u0026quot; ) Let’s see if that is any better.\nplot(out, particle_fit = TRUE) That is a much better fit.\nAny parameter that you could provide to run_explicit_SEEIR_model can be passed to calibrate. This includes time varying arguments such as contact_matrix_set, ICU_bed_capacity and hosp_bed_capacity. To incorporate these into model fitting correctly, the date at which these change must be provided (similarly to how date_R0_change was provided above) using date_ICU_bed_capacity_change, date_ICU_bed_capacity_change and date_hosp_bed_capacity_change respectively. In addition, the user must provide a baseline value for these, i.e. the contact matrix and bed capacity at the beginning of the epidemic:\nout \u0026lt;- calibrate( data = df, R0_min = 2, R0_max = 4, R0_step = 0.5, first_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-02-10\u0026quot;, last_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-02-22\u0026quot;, day_step = 4, replicates = 10, n_particles = 20, forecast = 14, R0_change = int_unique$change, date_R0_change = int_unique$dates_change, baseline_contact_matrix = get_mixing_matrix(\u0026quot;Algeria\u0026quot;), contact_matrix_set = list(get_mixing_matrix(\u0026quot;Algeria\u0026quot;)*0.9), date_contact_matrix_set_change = \u0026quot;2020-03-16\u0026quot;, baseline_hosp_bed_capacity = squire:::get_hosp_bed_capacity(\u0026quot;Algeria\u0026quot;), hosp_bed_capacity = squire:::get_hosp_bed_capacity(\u0026quot;Algeria\u0026quot;)*c(1.1,1.2), date_hosp_bed_capacity_change = c(\u0026quot;2020-04-02\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2020-04-08\u0026quot;), baseline_ICU_bed_capacity = squire:::get_ICU_bed_capacity(\u0026quot;Algeria\u0026quot;), ICU_bed_capacity = squire:::get_ICU_bed_capacity(\u0026quot;Algeria\u0026quot;)*c(1.05), date_ICU_bed_capacity_change = c(\u0026quot;2020-04-10\u0026quot;), country = \u0026quot;Algeria\u0026quot; ) (N.B. Given the potentially long running time for the grid search, the model state is returned at the end of every day rather than every time step (provided by dt). As a result model outputs such as n_E2_I (number of infections in a time step) and delta_D (number of deaths in a time step) reflect the outputs in the last time step rather than in all the time steps in the last day. The plotting functions and format_output provided in squire handle this correctly and work out the correct number for these in the last day.)\n5. Conducting scenario projections to fitted data Once you have calibrated the model to death data, it is possible to then implement mitigation strategies forwards in time from the point of calibration. This is achieved using the projections function. For example, let’s consider a country that as of 28th April 2020 is yet to experience an epidemic take off but may be about to. Guinea reported its first COVID-19 death on 16th April 2020 and has reported 7 deaths by the 28th April 2020 according to data from the European CDC.\nFirst let’s calibrate to this data with no interventions in place (there are likely some interventions in place but nothing major, such as a lockdown, has been implemented by 2020-04-28) and simulate forward for 180 days:\ndf \u0026lt;- read.csv(squire:::squire_file(\u0026quot;extdata/example_GIN.csv\u0026quot;), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) out \u0026lt;- calibrate( data = df, R0_min = 2.5, R0_max = 4, R0_step = 0.5, first_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-03-10\u0026quot;, last_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-03-25\u0026quot;, day_step = 5, replicates = 10, n_particles = 20, forecast = 180, country = \u0026quot;Guinea\u0026quot; ) Firstly, let’s plot the fit up to the current day\nplot(out, particle_fit = TRUE) + ggplot2::xlim(as.Date(c(\u0026quot;2020-04-10\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;2020-04-28\u0026quot;))) + ggplot2::ylim(c(0,10)) The fit is good and captures the stuttering chains at the beginning of the epidemic. However, if we plot the forecasted deaths we can see the epidemic is likely to take off:\nplot(out, \u0026quot;deaths\u0026quot;) #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. We can now use the output of calibrate to explore different scenario projections using projections. For example, to contast this unmitigated epidemic against a mitigation scenario with a 50% reduction in R0 today and a further 30% in 2 weeks time:\n# create our projections p \u0026lt;- projections(r = out, R0_change = c(0.5, 0.2), tt_R0 = c(0, 14)) The output generated from projections is the same class and structure as from calibrate and can be plotted against the unmitigated scenario using projection_plotting:\nggproj \u0026lt;- projection_plotting(r_list = list(out,p), scenarios = c(\u0026quot;Unmitigated\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Mitigation\u0026quot;), var_select = c(\u0026quot;ICU_occupancy\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ICU_demand\u0026quot;), add_parms_to_scenarios = TRUE,ci = FALSE,summarise = TRUE) # and lets add in the ICU capacity ggproj + ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = out$parameters$ICU_bed_capacity) #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. We can see above that the intervention introduced is nearly sufficient to prevent ICU demand (solid line red) from exceeding the supply, whereas in the unmitigated strategy this did occur.\nWe can also model changing interventions by changing the contact matrix over time as well as the availability of ICU and hospital beds. E.g. decreasing contacts by 75% in a week before relaxing it to 80% in 30 days time, while increasing hospital and ICU beds by 200% in 30 days time. (N.B. We can turn off the automatic scenario parameter labelling with add_parms_to_scenarios = FALSE):\n# create our projections p \u0026lt;- projections(r = out, contact_matrix_set_change = c(1, 0.25, 0.8), tt_contact_matrix = c(0, 7, 30), hosp_bed_capacity_change = c(1, 3), tt_hosp_beds = c(0, 30), ICU_bed_capacity_change = c(1, 3), tt_ICU_beds = c(0,30)) projection_plotting(r_list = list(out, p), scenarios = c(\u0026quot;Unmitigated\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Mitigation\u0026quot;), var_select = c(\u0026quot;ICU_occupancy\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ICU_demand\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;deaths\u0026quot;), add_parms_to_scenarios = FALSE, ci = FALSE,summarise = TRUE) + ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = out$parameters$ICU_bed_capacity) #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. Above we can see that the increase in bed causes the mitigation strategy to plateau at a higher bed occupancy, however, not high enough to meet the demand. However, the impacts to the contact matrix and beds have caused both a shift and a decrease in the daily deaths, which in turn causes a noticable decrease in total deaths:\nprojection_plotting(r_list = list(out,p), scenarios = c(\u0026quot;Unmitigated\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Mitigation\u0026quot;), var_select = c(\u0026quot;D\u0026quot;), add_parms_to_scenarios = FALSE, ci = FALSE,summarise = TRUE) #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. Rather than using relative changes to the interventions, we can provide absolute measures. For example, to change the R0 to 2 today and add 500 ICU beds in 40 days time:\n# what is the current capacity icu \u0026lt;- tail(out$parameters$ICU_bed_capacity,1) # create our projections p \u0026lt;- projections(r = out, R0 = 2, tt_R0 = 0, ICU_bed_capacity = c(icu, icu + 500), tt_ICU_beds = c(0,40)) projection_plotting(r_list = list(out,p), scenarios = c(\u0026quot;Unmitigated\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Mitigation\u0026quot;), var_select = c(\u0026quot;ICU_occupancy\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ICU_demand\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;deaths\u0026quot;), add_parms_to_scenarios = FALSE, ci = FALSE,summarise = TRUE) #\u0026gt; Warning: It is deprecated to specify `guide = FALSE` to remove a guide. Please #\u0026gt; use `guide = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;` instead. Lastly, in order to run simulations for longer than the number set in calibrate(forecast = x), we can use the argument time_period to set the numbers of days that projections should simulate for. For example, we could redo our calibration and have it only run up the current day:\ndf \u0026lt;- read.csv(squire:::squire_file(\u0026quot;extdata/example_GIN.csv\u0026quot;), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) out \u0026lt;- calibrate( data = df, R0_min = 2.5, R0_max = 4, R0_step = 0.5, first_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-03-10\u0026quot;, last_start_date = \u0026quot;2020-03-25\u0026quot;, day_step = 5, replicates = 10, n_particles = 20, forecast = 0, country = \u0026quot;Guinea\u0026quot; ) plot(out, particle_fit = TRUE) We can now use this to project 90 days forwards with the current level of interventions, as well as a projection of 90 days with a 50% reduction in R0:\np_no_change \u0026lt;- projections(out, time_period = 90) p_change \u0026lt;- projections(out, R0_change = 0.5, tt_R0 = 0, time_period = 90) projection_plotting(list(p_no_change, p_change), scenarios = c(\u0026quot;No Change\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;50% R0\u0026quot;), add_parms_to_scenarios = FALSE, var_select = \u0026quot;deaths\u0026quot;, date_0 = max(df$date), x_var = \u0026quot;date\u0026quot;) ","date":1609778332,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609778332,"objectID":"5ce4e8ec522f156eb8c4b1b5230adb42","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/2021/01/04/introduction-to-squire/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2021/01/04/introduction-to-squire/","section":"post","summary":"This is an overview of the squire package, which is a deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission.

METHODS: From mid-January to March 2020, we extracted publicly available data regarding the spread and control of COVID-19 from 31 provincial health authorities and major media outlets in mainland China. Based on these data, we conducted descriptive analyses of the epidemic in the six most-affected provinces. RESULTS: School closures, travel restrictions, community-level lockdown, and contact tracing were introduced concurrently around late January but subsequent epidemic trends differed among provinces. Compared with Hubei, the other five most-affected provinces reported a lower crude case fatality ratio and proportion of critical and severe hospitalised cases. From March 2020, as the local transmission of COVID-19 declined, switching the focus of measures to the testing and quarantine of inbound travellers may have helped to sustain the control of the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Aggregated indicators of case notifications and severity distributions are essential for monitoring an epidemic. A publicly available database containing these indicators and information regarding control measures is a useful resource for further research and policy planning in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.","tags":["Case fatality ratio","China","Contact","Contact Tracing","Control measure","COVID-19","Databases","Factual","Epidemic","Humans","SARS-CoV-2"],"title":"Database of epidemic trends and control measures during the first wave of COVID-19 in mainland China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas C.

We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. FINDINGS: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. INTERPRETATION: Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges.

We jointly model the US epidemic at the state-level, using publicly available death data within a Bayesian hierarchical semi-mechanistic framework.

This has led to substantial interest in their \\\"test, trace, isolate\\\" strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities of South Korea's outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to emulate these measures elsewhere. METHODS: We systematically extracted numbers of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases, and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using an established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government sources. RESULTS: We estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, Rt dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI, 1.64-2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June, Rt was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th). Despite less stringent \\\"lockdown\\\" measures, strong social distancing measures were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased, and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly; however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to be important for South Korea's successful outbreak control, other factors including regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed. The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases that are linked to clusters may be more difficult.","tags":["Bayes Theorem","Betacoronavirus","Clinical Laboratory Techniques","Contact tracing","Contact Tracing","Coronavirus Infections","COVID-19","COVID-19 Testing","Disease Outbreaks","Humans","Pandemics","Pneumonia","Viral","Public health interventions","Quarantine","Reproduction number","Republic of Korea","SARS-CoV-2","South Korea"],"title":"Response to COVID-19 in South Korea and implications for lifting stringent interventions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra B.

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. METHODS: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3·0, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. INTERPRETATION: Maintaining the most critical prevention activities and health-care services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could substantially reduce the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we assessed malaria risk factors among adults using samples from the nationally representative, cross-sectional 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We further explored differences in risk factors by urbanicity. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum infection was determined by PCR. Covariates were drawn from the DHS to model individual, community and environmental-level risk factors for infection. Additionally, we used deep sequencing data to estimate the community-level proportions of drug-resistant infections and included these estimates as potential risk factors. All identified factors were assessed for differences in associations by urbanicity. RESULTS: A total of 16 126 adults were included. Overall prevalence of malaria was 30.3% (SE=1.1) by PCR; province-level prevalence ranged from 6.7% to 58.3%. Only 17% of individuals lived in households with at least one bed-net for every two people, as recommended by the WHO. Protective factors included increasing within-household bed-net coverage (Prevalence Ratio=0.85, 95% CI=0.76-0.95) and modern housing (PR=0.58, 95% CI=0.49-0.69). Community-level protective factors included increased median wealth (PR=0.87, 95% CI=0.83-0.92). Education, wealth, and modern housing showed protective associations in cities but not in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The DRC continues to suffer from a high burden of malaria; interventions that target high-risk groups and sustained investment in malaria control are sorely needed. Areas of high prevalence should be prioritised for interventions to target the largest reservoirs for further transmission.","tags":["Adult","Cross-Sectional Studies","cross-sectional survey","Democratic Republic of the Congo","epidemiology","Humans","malaria","Malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","PCR","Plasmodium falciparum"],"title":"Spatial and epidemiological drivers of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among adults in the Democratic Republic of the Congo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Verity","Ozkan Aydemir","Nicholas F.

Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for actual population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Methods: Here, we use two mobile phone-based datasets (anonymised and aggregated crowd level data from O2 and from the Facebook app on mobile phones) to assess changes in average mobility, both overall and broken down into high and low population density areas, and changes in the distribution of journey lengths. Results: We show that there was a substantial overall reduction in mobility, with the most rapid decline on the 24th March 2020, the day after the Prime Minister's announcement of an enforced lockdown. The reduction in mobility was highly synchronized across the UK. Although mobility has remained low since 26th March 2020, we detect a gradual increase since that time. We also show that the two different datasets produce similar trends, albeit with some location-specific differences. We see slightly larger reductions in average mobility in high-density areas than in low-density areas, with greater variation in mobility in the high-density areas: some high-density areas eliminated almost all mobility.

Despite consistent implementation of effective tools since 2002, elimination has not been achieved. Importation of parasites from outside of the archipelago is thought to be an important cause of malaria's persistence, but this paradigm has not been studied using modern genetic tools. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate the impact of importation, employing population genetic analyses of Plasmodium falciparum isolates from both the archipelago and mainland Tanzania. Ancestry, levels of genetic diversity and differentiation, patterns of relatedness, and patterns of selection between these two populations were assessed by leveraging recent advances in deconvolution of genomes from polyclonal malaria infections. RESULTS: Significant decreases in the effective population sizes were inferred in both populations that coincide with a period of decreasing malaria transmission in Tanzania. Identity by descent analysis showed that parasites in the two populations shared long segments of their genomes, on the order of 5 cM, suggesting shared ancestry within the last 10 generations. Even with limited sampling, two of isolates between the mainland and Zanzibar were identified that are related at the expected level of half-siblings, consistent with recent importation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that importation plays an important role for malaria incidence on Zanzibar and demonstrate the value of genomic approaches for identifying corridors of parasite movement to the island.","tags":["Cohort Studies","Demography","Gene Library","Genetic Variation","Haploidy","Haplotypes","Humans","Incidence","Islands","Malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","Mutation","Plasmodium","Plasmodium falciparum","Population genetics","Tanzania","Travel","Whole Genome Sequencing"],"title":"Falciparum malaria from coastal Tanzania and Zanzibar remains highly connected despite effective control efforts on the archipelago","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

This study explores longitudinal changes in spatial patterns to understand how resistant malaria may be spreading within the DRC, using samples from nation-wide population-representative surveys. METHODS: We selected 552 children with PCR-detectable Plasmodium falciparum infection and identified known variants in the pfdhps and pfcrt genes associated with resistance. We compared the proportion of mutant parasites in 2013 to those previously reported from adults in 2007, and identified risk factors for carrying a resistant allele using multivariate mixed-effects modeling. Finally, we fit a spatial-temporal model to the observed data, providing smooth allele frequency estimates over space and time. RESULTS: The proportion of co-occurring pfdhps K540E/A581G mutations increased by 16% between 2007 and 2013. The spatial-temporal model suggests that the spatial range of the pfdhps double mutants expanded over time, while the prevalence and range of pfcrt mutations remained steady.

To begin with I thought it best to describe what problem rdhs tries to solve, why it was developed and how I came to be involved in this project. I then give a brief overview of what the package can do, before continuing to describe how writing my first proper package and the rOpenSci review process was. Lastly I wanted to share a couple of things that I learnt along the way. These are not very clever or difficult things, but rather things that were difficult to Google, which now I think about it should probably be the best metric for a difficult problem.\nMotivation What is the DHS Program The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) Program has collected and disseminated population survey data from over 90 countries for over 30 years. This amounts to over 400 surveys that give representative data on health indicators, which in many countries provides the key data that mark progress towards targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, DHS survey data has been used to inform health policy such as detailing trends in child mortality1 and characterising the distribution of malaria control interventions in Africa in order to map the burden of malaria2.\nThis is all to the say that the DHS provides really useful data. However, although standard health indicators are routinely published in the survey final reports that are published by the DHS program, much of the value of the DHS data is derived from the ability to download and analyse the raw datasets for subgroup analysis, pooled multi-country analysis, and extended research studies.\nThis where I got involved, in trying to create a tool that helped enable researchers to quickly gain access to the raw data sets.\nHow I got involved I am fortunate enough to be a PhD student in a really large department at Imperial College London, which means that I get the opportunity to be involved in many projects that are outside the scope of my actual PhD. The “downside” of that is sometimes you get given “code monkey” jobs as the bottom rung of the monkey ladder. And so, a few months into my PhD (Nov 2016), I was given the job of downloading data on malaria test results from the DHS program that was going to be used by some collaborators. At the time I was very happy to be involved, however, I was apprehensive to spend too long on the job as I didn’t know how much time to be spending on side projects vs my PhD (something I still don’t know with 6 months to go). This combined with only having a year or so’s experience writing R meant that the code I wrote to do the job was a bunch of scrappy scripts that required manually downloading the datasets before parsing them with these R scripts. Dirty but it got the job done.\nSome time passed, and another collaborator wanted some different data collated from the DHS program. At this point, I had 6 more months familiarity with R and knew a bit more so I started writing it as an R package. However, it was still messy and it required manually downloading the datasets first, but I was happy with it and again it wasn’t a major project of mine. This would have been probably where the project ended if I hadn’t had a conversation (Sept 2017) in the tea room (prompted solely by the presence of free biscuits) with the other main author of rdhs, Jeff Eaton.\nWe got chatting, and realised we both had a bunch of scripts for doing bits of the analysis pipeline. We also realised that we had both had numerous requests for data sets from the DHS program at which point we thought it would be best to do something properly. I had also at this point been keen to start using testhat within my work as I had been told it would save me time in the future, and up till that point I hadn’t found a good case to get to grips with it (mainly writing code on my own, that was never very big and was only used by myself). And so we started writing rdhs, which was accepted by rOpenSci and CRAN in December 2018.\nPackage overview Disclaimer: The following section (the API and Dataset Downloads headings) is an overiew of the Introduction Vignette. If you want a longer introduction to the package then head there, otherwise carry on and eventually you will get to my ramblings about the package development process.\nMost of the functionality of rdhs can be roughly summarised in the 5 main steps that are involved from wanting to get data on x to having a curated data set created from survey data from multiple surveys. These steps involve:\nAccessing standard survey indicators through the DHS API. Using the API to identifying the surveys and datasets relevant to your particular analysis, i.e. the ones that ask questions related to your topic of interest. Downloading survey datasets from the DHS website. Loading the datasets and associated metadata into R. Extracting variables and combining datasets for pooled multi-survey analyses. We will quickly cover these 5 main steps, with the first 2 showing how rdhs functions as an API client and the last 3 points showing how rdhs can be used to download raw data sets from the DHS website. Before we have a look at these, let’s first load rdhs:\nlibrary(rdhs) API 1. Access standard indicator data via the API The DHS program has published an API that gives access to 12 different data sets. Each API endpoint represents one of the 12 data sets (e.g. https://api.dhsprogram.com/rest/dhs/tags), and can be accessed using the dhs_\u0026lt;\u0026gt;() functions. For more information about this see the DHS API website.\nOne of those functions, dhs_data(), interacts with the the published set of standard health indicator data calculated by the DHS. For example, to find out the trends in antimalarial use in Africa, and see if perhaps antimalarial prescription has decreased after rapid diagnostic tests were introduced (assumed 2010).\n# Make an api request resp \u0026lt;- dhs_data(indicatorIds = \u0026quot;ML_FEVT_C_AML\u0026quot;, surveyYearStart = 2010,breakdown = \u0026quot;subnational\u0026quot;) # filter it to 12 countries for space countries \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Angola\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Ghana\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Kenya\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Liberia\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Madagascar\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Mali\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Malawi\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Nigeria\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Rwanda\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Sierra Leone\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Senegal\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Tanzania\u0026quot;) # and plot the results library(ggplot2) ggplot(resp[resp$CountryName %in% countries,], aes(x=SurveyYear,y=Value,colour=CountryName)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;glm\u0026quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5)) + ylab(resp$Indicator[1]) + facet_wrap(~CountryName,ncol = 6) 2. Identify surveys relevant for further analysis You may, however, wish to do more nuanced analysis than the API allows. The following 4 sections detail a very basic example of how to quickly identify, download and extract datasets you are interested in.\nLet’s say we want to get all DHS survey data from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania in the last 5 years (since 2013), which covers the use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (“RDT” below). To begin we’ll interact with the DHS API to identify our datasets.\n## make a call with no arguments sc \u0026lt;- dhs_survey_characteristics() sc[grepl(\u0026quot;Malaria\u0026quot;, sc$SurveyCharacteristicName), ] ## SurveyCharacteristicID SurveyCharacteristicName ## 57 96 Malaria - DBS ## 58 90 Malaria - Microscopy ## 59 89 Malaria - RDT ## 60 57 Malaria module ## 61 8 Malaria/bednet questions There are 87 different survey characteristics, with one specific survey characteristic for malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). In this example we will use this to find the surveys that include this characteristic. (There are other ways to find the datasets with the API and other options to control how to filter the API, which are explored here)\n# lets find all the surveys that fit our search criteria survs \u0026lt;- dhs_surveys(surveyCharacteristicIds = 89, countryIds = c(\u0026quot;CD\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;TZ\u0026quot;), surveyType = \u0026quot;DHS\u0026quot;, surveyYearStart = 2013) # and lastly use this to find the datasets we will want to download # and let\u0026#39;s download the flat files (.dat) datasets datasets \u0026lt;- dhs_datasets(surveyIds = survs$SurveyId, fileFormat = \u0026quot;flat\u0026quot;, fileType = \u0026quot;PR\u0026quot;) str(datasets) ## \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 2 obs. of 13 variables: ## $ FileFormat : chr \u0026quot;Flat ASCII data (.dat)\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Flat ASCII data (.dat)\u0026quot; ## $ FileSize : int 6595349 6622102 ## $ DatasetType : chr \u0026quot;Survey Datasets\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Survey Datasets\u0026quot; ## $ SurveyNum : int 421 485 ## $ SurveyId : chr \u0026quot;CD2013DHS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TZ2015DHS\u0026quot; ## $ FileType : chr \u0026quot;Household Member Recode\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Household Member Recode\u0026quot; ## $ FileDateLastModified: chr \u0026quot;September, 19 2016 09:58:23\u0026quot; \u0026quot;August, 07 2018 17:36:25\u0026quot; ## $ SurveyYearLabel : chr \u0026quot;2013-14\u0026quot; \u0026quot;2015-16\u0026quot; ## $ SurveyType : chr \u0026quot;DHS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;DHS\u0026quot; ## $ SurveyYear : int 2013 2015 ## $ DHS_CountryCode : chr \u0026quot;CD\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TZ\u0026quot; ## $ FileName : chr \u0026quot;CDPR61FL.ZIP\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TZPR7AFL.ZIP\u0026quot; ## $ CountryName : chr \u0026quot;Congo Democratic Republic\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Tanzania\u0026quot; We can now use this to download our datasets for further analysis.\nDataset Downloads 3. Download survey datasets To be able to download survey datasets from the DHS website, we need to set up an account through the DHS website to enable you to request access to the datasets. Instructions on how to do this can be found here.\nOnce we have created an account, we set up our credentials using the function set_rdhs_config(). See the Introduction Vignette for more clarity about the various options for setting up your config.\n## set up your credentials set_rdhs_config(email = \u0026quot;rdhs.tester@gmail.com\u0026quot;, project = \u0026quot;Testing Malaria Investigations\u0026quot;, cache_path = \u0026quot;project_one\u0026quot;, config_path = \u0026quot;~/.rdhs.json\u0026quot;, data_frame = \u0026quot;data.table::as.data.table\u0026quot;, global = TRUE) We can now download the data sets we identified earlier from the API, using get_datasets:\n# download datasets downloads \u0026lt;- get_datasets(datasets$FileName) 4. Load datasets and associated metadata into R We can now examine what it is we have actually downloaded, by reading in one of these datasets:\n# read in our dataset cdpr \u0026lt;- readRDS(downloads$CDPR61FL) The dataset returned here contains all the survey questions within the dataset.\nThe dataset is by default stored as a labelled class from the haven package.\nIf we want to get the data dictionary for this dataset, we can use the function get_variable_labels:\n# let\u0026#39;s look at the variable_names head(get_variable_labels(cdpr)) ## variable description ## 1 hhid Case Identification ## 2 hvidx Line number ## 3 hv000 Country code and phase ## 4 hv001 Cluster number ## 5 hv002 Household number ## 6 hv003 Respondent\u0026#39;s line number (answering Household questionnaire) The default behaviour for the function get_datasets was to download the datasets, read them in, and save the resultant data.frame as a .rds object within the cache directory. It also creates the data dictionary and caches this for you, which allows us to quickly query for particular variables or variable_labels:\n# rapid diagnostic test search questions \u0026lt;- search_variable_labels(datasets$FileName, search_terms = \u0026quot;malaria rapid test\u0026quot;) Or if we know what variables we want, we can identify which surveys include these:\n# and grab the questions from this now utilising the survey variables questions \u0026lt;- search_variables(datasets$FileName, variables = c(\u0026quot;hv024\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;hml35\u0026quot;)) head(questions) ## variable description dataset_filename ## 1 hv024 Province CDPR61FL ## 2 hml35 Result of malaria rapid test CDPR61FL ## 3 hv024 Region TZPR7AFL ## 4 hml35 Result of malaria rapid test TZPR7AFL ## dataset_path ## 1 /home/oj/GoogleDrive/AcademicWork/Imperial/git/rdhs/paper/project_one/datasets/CDPR61FL.rds ## 2 /home/oj/GoogleDrive/AcademicWork/Imperial/git/rdhs/paper/project_one/datasets/CDPR61FL.rds ## 3 /home/oj/GoogleDrive/AcademicWork/Imperial/git/rdhs/paper/project_one/datasets/TZPR7AFL.rds ## 4 /home/oj/GoogleDrive/AcademicWork/Imperial/git/rdhs/paper/project_one/datasets/TZPR7AFL.rds ## survey_id ## 1 CD2013DHS ## 2 CD2013DHS ## 3 TZ2015DHS ## 4 TZ2015DHS More information about download options and querying the survey questions can be found here\n5. Extract variables and combine datasets To extract our data we pass our questions object to the function extract_dhs, which will create a list with each dataset and its extracted data as a data.frame.\n# extract the data and add geographic information too extract \u0026lt;- extract_dhs(questions, add_geo = FALSE) The resultant extract is a list, with a new element for each different dataset that you have extracted. We can now combine our two data frames for further analysis using the rdhs package function rbind_labelled():\n# first let\u0026#39;s bind our first extraction, without the hv024 extract_bound \u0026lt;- rbind_labelled(extract) ## Warning in rbind_labelled(extract): Some variables have non-matching value labels: hv024. ## Inheriting labels from first data frame with labels. The thrown warning has shown us that hv024 did not have matching labels between the two lists, and the labels from the first list have been used. hv024 stores the regions for these 2 countries, and we probably want to keep all the labels, which we can do by using the labels argument:\n# lets try concatenating the hv024 better_bound \u0026lt;- rbind_labelled(extract, labels = list(\u0026quot;hv024\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;concatenate\u0026quot;)) We could also specify new labels for a variable. For example, imagine the two datasets encoded their rapid diagnostic test responses differently, with the first one as c(\"No\",\"Yes\") and the other as c(\"Negative\",\"Positive\"). We can choose to relabel these, e.g. as c(\"NegativeTest\",\"PositiveTest\"):\n# lets try concatenating the hv024 and providing new labels better_bound \u0026lt;- rbind_labelled( extract, labels = list(\u0026quot;hv024\u0026quot;=\u0026quot;concatenate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hml35\u0026quot;=c(\u0026quot;NegativeTest\u0026quot;=0, \u0026quot;PositiveTest\u0026quot;=1)) ) # and our new label head(attr(better_bound$hml35,\u0026quot;labels\u0026quot;)) ## NegativeTest PositiveTest ## 0 1 For more information about controlling how to extract data from your downloaded sections, see the last section in the introduction vignette.\nWe now have managed to go from our initial request for data about the use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria to a finalised data set that we can use going forwards for any downstream analysis (and hopefully it didn’t take that long to do it!). This data set includes survey responses from multiple surveys within one data frame, which in this case includes data from Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, it would be easy to extend our earlier API query to include more countries. For example if we had not limited our search to these 2 countries, the same code as above would have returned data from over 200,000 individuals across 21 countries. Similarly if we wanted to include more survey responses, we could have provided different search terms to search_variables or search_variable_labels. By widening our search terms, and including more datasets within the search we can easily create data sets that can be used to answer important global health questions such as:\nWhich malaria RDTs are performing worse in low malaria prevalence regoions? What is the link between HIV prevalence and wealth? How far apart should births occur to minmise childhood mortality? Ramblings after my first completed package Clichéd but the process of actually writing a package, and all that entailed, was a real highlight. I had made R packages before, but I had never done everything that a good R package should have (tests, effective continuous integration, full documentation, a pkgdown website, contribution and code of conduct guides, and so on). One particular highlight for me was actually having the opportunity to work on a code base with someone else in a collaborative way. I work in a large collaborative group, however, this has not translated as much to working on the same set of code with someone. As a result I’ve never had to properly learn how to use git outside of clone, commit and push, nor had I made use of much of the useful aspects of GitHub. So learning how to correctly use branches in git and realising that helpful comments are actually helpful (eventually) was really great. With this in mind I wanted to thank Jeff Eaton again for taking on this project. He definitely helped drive it over the finish line, and it was nice to have a glimpse at what working as a developer would look like if I decide to leave pure academia.\nThere were also a few things that before I started writing rdhs I knew I would have to figure out but I didn’t have a clue where to start, and for which repeated googling didn’t eventually help with. Fortunately, I work in the same department as Rich FitzJohn, so it was great having someone to point me in the right direction. The following are three of the things that I genuinely had no idea how to do before, so I thought I’d share them here (and so I can remind myself in the future):\n1. Logging into a website from R The DHS website has a download manager that you can use to select surveys you want to download, and it will auto generate a list of URLs in a text file. When I saw this, I thought this would be great for creating a database of what data sets and the URLs a user’s login details can give them, which can then be cached so that rdhs knows whether you can download a data set or not. The only problem is, that to download those data sets you need to be logged in, and you also need to be logged in to get to the download manager. For me, I didn’t know how to translate being “logged in” into R code, or even what that looked like. But turns out it wasn’t too bad after being shown by Rich where to start looking.\nTo know where to look I opened up Chrome and went to developer tools. From there I opened up the Network Tab, which then records the information being sent to the URL. So to know what information is required to login I simply logged in as normal, and then inspected what appeared in the network tab’s Headers Tab. This then showed me what the needed Request URL was, and what information was being submitted in the Form Data at the bottom of this tab.\nI could then use this information to log in from with R using an httr::POST request:\n# authentication page terms \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset_admin/login_main.cfm\u0026quot; # create a temporary file tf \u0026lt;- tempfile(fileext = \u0026quot;.txt\u0026quot;) # set the username and password values \u0026lt;- list( UserName = your_email, UserPass = your_password, Submitted = 1, UserType = 2 ) # log in. message(\u0026quot;Logging into DHS website...\u0026quot;) z \u0026lt;- httr::POST(terms, body = values) %\u0026gt;% handle_api_response(to_json = FALSE) To me, this seemed really cool, and then meant I could do the same style of steps to get to the Download Manager webpage and then tick all the check boxes in the page to generate the URL with all the download links in.\n2. Caching API results from a changing API We wanted to be able to cache a user’s API request for them locally when designing rdhs. We felt this was important as it would reduce the burden on the API itself, as well as enable researchers who were without internet (e.g. currently working in the field), the ability to still access previous API requests. However, designing something neat that would be easy to respond to changes in the API version would I thought be outside my skill set.\nAgain, enter Rich and this time with his package storr. This was a lifesaver, and created an easy infrastructure for storing API responses in a key-value store. I could then use the specific API URL as the key and the response as the value. Initially I thought I would have to keep saving the response with explicit names (e.g. the URL), but storr handles all this for you, and also then helps get around having too long file names if your API request is very long for example.\nTo respond to changes in the API, my solution was perhaps not the neatest, but I simply kept a record of the date you last made an API request and compared it to the API’s data updates endpoint. If I could see any recent changes, I then could clear all the API requests cached. This would made a lot simpler using the namespaces options in storr, which meant that I was able to keep all API cached data in one place, which could then be easily deleted on mass.\n3. Tests, Travis \u0026amp; Authentication The last thing caused me the most amount of headaches. How do I write tests that require authentication and can use travis for continuous integration. Initially, I made a dummy account with the DHS website for this, but realised that sharing the credentials of an account with access to just dummy data sets would not enable me to test the weird edge cases that started popping up related to certain data sets. The first solution that I used for a few months was to set up environment variables within travis itself, which could then be used to create a valid set of credentials.\nThis worked, however, it meant that I would have to write a lot of the rdhs functionality to use environment variables that were the user’s email and password, which felt wrong and quite clunky. All I wanted was to pass to Travis a valid set of login credentials that would then be used within the tests, much in the same way that a user would. To do this I had to learn a bit more about what the .travis.yml document could actually be used for, because to begin with I had only been using it to specify the software language.\nAgain, Rich pointed me to using sodium to create an encrypted version of a valid login credentials:\n# read in a key from a local file key \u0026lt;- sodium::hash(charToRaw(readLines(\u0026quot;scripts/key.txt\u0026quot;))) # create a tat with all the necessary login credentials zip(\u0026quot;rdhs.json.tar\u0026quot;,files=c(\u0026quot;rdhs.json\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tests/testthat/rdhs.json\u0026quot;)) # read this tar in as binary data dat \u0026lt;- readBin(\u0026quot;rdhs.json.tar\u0026quot;,raw(),file.size(\u0026quot;rdhs.json.tar\u0026quot;)) # encrypt the data using sodium and our key before saving it enc \u0026lt;- sodium::data_encrypt(msg = dat,key = key) saveRDS(enc,\u0026quot;rdhs.json.tar.enc\u0026quot;) This encrypted copy could be included in the GitHub repository, and I could set up the key as a Travis environment variable to decrypt it. This decryption step could then be written within my .travis.yml file, and would mean that all my tests had access to my login credentials in a secure way.\nOptions to Contribute There are a few things that would be great to add in the future.\nAdding a suite of tools for doing spatial mapping. A lot of the time, people want to know what the prevalence of x is either at a fine spatial scale, or grouped at administrative/county/state levels. rdhs helps provide the tools to get geolocated measures of x, and I think it would be a great next step to add a suite of mapping tools. It would be great if they could be used to either create a mesh through these points (probably using INLA), or calculate survey weighted means at requested spatial scales or match them to a provided SpatialPolygons object. Related to this is it would be good to also link in the Spatial Data Repository from the DHS, so that users can easily download shape files for their analyses (issue #71).\nNot related to any specific issues, but it would be good to have a clearer set of downstream analysis pipelines. One example is a package in development by Jeff Eaton called demogsurv, which is used to calculate common demographic indicators from household survey data, including child mortality, adult mortality, and fertility. This is just one example, but over time there will be a number of bespoke analysis tools down the line, and so it would be nice to begin a collection/grouping of these tools (possibly as a wiki or similar).\nIt would be nice to have a way to manually add sources of survey data. At the moment the pipeline for downloading raw data sets used the DHS API a lot, however, what if you had some survey data (either locally or shared at a URL) that you wanted to bring into your analysis pipeline. Something similar to this is done for the model_datasets within rdhs, which is a set of dummy data sets that the DHS hosts online but are not included in their API.\nAcknowledgements and Final Thoughts Firstly, I want to thank Anna Krystalli for handling the review, and for being incredibly patient throughout, especially at the end as we were fixing the last authentication bug. Also many thanks to Lucy McGowan and Duncan Gillespie for taking the time to review the package and for their input, which led to lots of improvements (and also linking the add_line function from httr was seriously helpful, and I’ve used that function in lots of other my other work now). I also wanted to more broadly thank the review process as a whole. Having the option to discuss the package and needed solutions with the reviewers within a GitHub issues system is fantastic. It made the process personal and was substantially improved over review processes I have had at academic journals. Lastly, another big thank you Jeff Eaton and Rich FitzJohn, and also to the infectious disease epidemiology department at Imperial for providing a lot of really helpful ginuea pig testing of the numerous iterations of rdhs.\nSilva, Romesh. 2012. “Child Mortality Estimation: Consistency of Under-Five Mortality Rate Estimates Using Full Birth Histories and Summary Birth Histories.” PLoS Medicine 9: e1001296. doi:[10.1371/journal.pmed.1001296](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001296).↩︎\nBhatt, S, D J Weiss, E Cameron, D Bisanzio, B Mappin, U Dalrymple, K E Battle, et al. 2015. “The effect of malaria control on Plasmodium falciparum in Africa between 2000 and 2015.”Nature 526: 207–11. doi:[10.1038/nature15535](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15535).↩︎\n","date":154872e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":154872e4,"objectID":"886783c4d8d568720f1d27644eaee84d","permalink":"https://nicholasbrazeau.com/2019/01/29/rdhs/","publishdate":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2019/01/29/rdhs/","section":"post","summary":"This is a copy of my article for ROpenSci detailing the rdhs package:\nThere seem to be a lot of ways to write about your R package, and rather than have to decide on what to focus on I thought I’d write a little bit about everything.

Shared medical appointments (SMA) have been shown to improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that the SMA model could be adapted for a non-profit clinic in North Carolina that serves uninsured patients with diabetes that have incomes at/below 150% of the federal poverty line. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We implemented and sustained a patient-driven, student-led SMA model that incorporated the monthly rotations of students, physician assistant, and undergraduate students as well as pharmacy residents and an endocrinologist who collectively provide diabetes care at the free clinic. SMA groups are 'open' cohorts and include 4-12 patients scheduled for the monthly clinic. Teams of transdisciplinary trainees work together to perform triage, medication reconciliation, brief history, and physical exam, after which patients participate in the SMA. The endocrinologist evaluates SMA patients individually during and after the visit. RESULTS: Between November 2015 and January 2017, we enrolled 29 patients in SMA. There was high variability in HbA1c at baseline. Among eight type 2 diabetes patients seen in endocrine clinic and with complete data one year before and after SMA implementation, the mean (SD) HbA1c before SMA was 9.7% ± 1.7% (83±7 mmol/ mol); mean HbA1c after SMA was 9.2% ± 1.8% (77 ± 8mmol/mol). The median HbA1c before SMA was 9.5% (80 mmol/mol); median HbA1c after SMA was 8.9% (74 mmol/mol). Overall, 6/8 patients showed decreased HbA1c after SMA although there was variability between individuals in response of glycemic control to SMA. SMA increased clinic efficiency and offered an opportunity to integrate transdisciplinary trainees. Trainees gain experience with novel models of care and the complexities of the patient experience of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: We hope this observation encourages others to implement such programs to enhance the evidence-base for SMA to address health disparities and increase the quality of free diabetes care.","tags":["Free clinic","Interdisciplinary","Shared medical appointments","Type 2 diabetes"],"title":"Implementation and Evaluation of Shared Medical Appointments for Type 2 Diabetes at a Free, Student-Run Clinic in Alamance County, North Carolina","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian M.

Principle component analysis, network analysis and demographic inference identified a diverse central population with three clusters of clonally expanding parasite populations, each associated with specific K13 artemisinin resistance alleles and partner drug resistance profiles which were consistent with the sequential deployment of artemisinin combination therapies in the region. One cluster displayed ex vivo piperaquine resistance and mefloquine sensitivity with a high rate of in vivo failure of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Another cluster displayed ex vivo mefloquine resistance and piperaquine sensitivity with high in vivo efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The final cluster was clonal and displayed intermediate sensitivity to both drugs. Variations in recently described piperaquine resistance markers did not explain the difference in mean IC90 or clinical failures between the high and intermediate piperaquine resistance groups, suggesting additional loci may be involved in resistance. The results highlight an important role for partner drug resistance in shaping the P. falciparum genetic landscape in Southeast Asia and suggest that further work is needed to evaluate for other mutations that drive piperaquine resistance.","tags":["ACT","Adult","Antipruritics","Artemisinins","Cambodia","drug resistance","Drug Resistance","ex vivo susceptibility","Female","Humans","kelch","malaria","Malaria","Falciparum","Male","mefloquine","Mefloquine","partner drug","pfmdr1","Phylogeny","piperaquine","plasmodium","Plasmodium falciparum","population genetics","Protozoan Proteins","Quinolines","Treatment Failure"],"title":"Partner-Drug Resistance and Population Substructuring of Artemisinin-Resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["r"],"content":" Talk at ASTMH 2016 on pfhrp2/3 deletions.

Extracted DNA from Cambodian isolates collected between 2009 and 2012 was pooled by province and year and submitted for next-generation sequencing. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using a pile-up approach that detected minority SNPs. Among the 14 pools, we found six unique SNPs, including three nonsynonymous SNPs, across six codons in K12 However, none of the SNPs were orthologous to artemisinin resistance-conferring mutations in PF3D7_1343700, and nonsynonymous changes did not persist through time within populations. These results suggest a lack of selection in the P. vivax population in Cambodia due to artemisinin drug pressure.","tags":["Antimalarials","Artemisinins","Cambodia","Drug Resistance","Genetic Markers","Humans","Malaria","Vivax","Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques","Plasmodium vivax","Selection","Genetic"],"title":"Longitudinal Pooled Deep Sequencing of the Plasmodium vivax K12 Kelch Gene in Cambodia Reveals a Lack of Selection by Artemisinin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard W.

Palm-to-palm clasping (PPC) is a distinct style of high-arm grooming in which the grooming partners clasp each other's raised palms. In wild communities, samples of at least 100 observed dyads grooming with raised hands showed PPC frequencies varying from textless5% (M group, Mahale) to textgreater30% dyads grooming (Kanyawara, Kibale), and in a large free-ranging sanctuary group, the frequency reached textgreater80% dyads (group 1, Chimfunshi) [1, 2]. Because between-community differences in frequency of PPC apparently result from social learning, are stable across generations, and last for at least 9 years, they are thought to be cultural, but the mechanism of transmission is unknown [2]. Here, we examine factors responsible for individual variation in PPC frequency within a single wild community. We found that in the Kanyawara community (Kibale, Uganda), adults of both sexes varied widely in their PPC frequency (from textless10% to textgreater50%) and did not converge on a central group tendency. However, frequencies of PPC were highly consistent within matrilines, indicating that individuals maintained lifelong fidelity to the grooming style of their mothers. Matrilineal inheritance of socially learned behaviors has previously been reported for tool use in chimpanzees [3] and in the vocal and feeding behavior of cetaceans [4, 5]. Our evidence indicates that matrilineal inheritance can be sufficiently strong in nonhuman primates to account for long-term differences in community traditions.","tags":["Animals","behavioral diffusion","conformity","conservatism","Female","Grooming","hand-clasp grooming","high-arm grooming","Male","palm-to-palm clasp","Pan troglodytes","Social Behavior","Social Learning","social tradition","transmission bias","Uganda"],"title":"Distribution of a Chimpanzee Social Custom Is Explained by Matrilineal Relationship Rather Than Conformity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

However, recent studies of wild ape dentitions have cast doubt on the use of developmental standards derived from captive individuals. Others have called into question the use of deceased wild individuals to infer normative development. We conducted a high resolution photographic study of living known-age subadults in the Kanyawara community (Kibale National Park, Uganda) to generate a comprehensive three year record of dental eruption (including tooth emergence ages). These non-invasive data allow comparisons of captive and wild chimpanzees, establish accurate developmental standards for relatively healthy wild individuals, and facilitate direct assessments of primate-wide associations between dental development and life history. Emergence ages in the Kanyawara chimpanzees are very similar to living Gombe chimpanzees, and are broadly comparable to deceased Taï Forest chimpanzees. Early-emerging teeth such as the deciduous dentition and first molar (M1) appear during a time of maternal dependence, and are almost indistinguishable from captive chimpanzee emergence ages, while later forming teeth in the Kanyawara population emerge in the latter half of captive age ranges or beyond. Five juveniles whose lower M1s emerged by or before 3.3 years of age continued to nurse for a year or more beyond M1 emergence, and their mothers showed considerable variation in reproductive rates. The third molars of two adolescent females emerged several months to several years prior to the birth of their first offspring. Given that broad primate-wide relationships between molar emergence and life history do not necessarily hold within this population of chimpanzees, particularly for variables that are reported to be coincident with molar emergence, we suggest that further study is required in order to predict life history variables in hominins or hominoids.","tags":["Adaptation","Physiological","Africa","Eastern","Aging","Animals","Biological Evolution","Dental development","Female","Human evolution","Life history","Male","Molar","Pan troglodytes","Tooth emergence","Tooth Eruption","Weaning"],"title":"Dental eruption in East African wild chimpanzees","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas F.

We identified a subset of patients who underwent contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging of the pelvis six months before or anytime after the MRV and did not undergo any interventional venous procedures between the two studies; 36 patients met these criteria. The degree of venous compression was calculated in both the index and comparison study. RESULTS: On the index MRV, the mean compression of the LCIV was 62%. However, on the comparison study in the same patients, the mean compression was 39%. The mean change in degree of compression between the two studies was 23% (P textless 0.0001), ranging from a 12% increase to 69% decrease in degree of compression on the comparison study.
